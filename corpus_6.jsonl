We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The ATMP JVs, Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) and King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.\n\n\nIntellectual Property and Licensing\n\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 30, 2023, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United States and approximately 2,000 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 18,500 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 12,800 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n\nBacklog\n\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty.\n\n\nSeasonality\n\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, we had approximately 26,000 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following:\n\n\nMission, Culture, and Engagement\n\n\nOur History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global company achieving many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop high-performance and adaptive computing to solve some of the world's toughest and most interesting challenges.\n\n\nOur Vision - High performance and adaptive computing is transforming our lives.\n\n\nOur Mission - Build great products that accelerate next-generation computing experiences.\n\n\nOur employees are driven by this vision and mission. Innovation occurs when creative minds and diverse perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of our unique culture and the reason why we believe our employees are among the most engaged in our industry.\n\n\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe conduct a confidential annual survey of our global workforce to measure our culture, engagement, and manager quality. The results are reviewed by our Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership team and individual managers at every level. Results from our 2023 survey reported scores that continued to be among the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees described our culture as inclusive, innovative, open, and respectful, and rated the quality of our managers among the top 10% of our technology industry peers.\n\n\nDiversity, Belonging and Inclusion (DB&I)\n\n\nOur diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes our company stronger. Our Employee Resource Groups, which are open to all our employees, encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our culture. More than 85% of all new hires join at least one of AMD's employee resource groups when starting employment.\n\n\nWe are focused on hiring and developing underrepresented groups and women leaders. In 2023, we increased focus on developing our female engineering community by launching an experiential program, \"Advancing Women in Technology,\" that aims to support career development. We are proud to be led by Dr. Lisa Su, a highly regarded CEO who has won many esteemed awards for her business and leadership prowess.\n\n\nTotal Rewards\n\n\nWe invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the industry's best and brightest in an equitable manner. We perform pay equity analysis regularly and act on results, if warranted. Our rewards are guided by employees' preferences and the market for talent. We focus on flexibility and choice in our benefits that resonate with a multi-generational workforce as well as offering inclusive benefits that support our DB&I objectives, such as global parental and bereavement leave, and financial assistance to build a family through adoption or surrogacy. While we believe that there is unique collaboration that can occur when employees meet in person, we have not mandated that all employees return to the office five days a week, allowing flexibility with hybrid and remote work as options for our employees.\n\n\nWe have a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives superior results. Our employees have benefited from our robust financial results through our strong short-term and long-term incentive programs. Our rewards programs enable us to attract, retain and motivate our workforce.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nWe offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at the Company and the majority of our new leaders are promoted from within.

Further, our executive team holds frequent employee roundtables, town halls and global team meetings with question-and-answer segments which facilitates open communication and feedback from our workforce.\n\n\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGovernment Regulations\n\n\nOur global operations are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to export control, customs, intellectual property, data privacy and security, climate, environmental, health and safety requirements, cybersecurity, tax, employment, competition and anti-trust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, conflict minerals, corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, and AI. Compliance with these governmental laws and regulations do not presently have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. However, compliance with changes to existing or new regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, the failure to comply with government laws and regulations may subject us to consequences including fines, limits on our ability to sell our products, suspension of certain of our business activities, reputational damage, criminal and civil liabilities, and sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on ourcapital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.For additional information about government regulations applicable to our business, and their potential impacts see Risk Factors in Item 1A.\n\n\nEnvironmental Regulations\n\n\nOur operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.\n\n\nCertain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders forthreesites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at thesethreesites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\n\n\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to thethreesites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\n\n\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4.8million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change.

These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel also dominates the computer system platform and has a heavy influence on PC manufacturers, other PC industry participants, and benchmarks. It is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We may be materially adversely affected by Intel's business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; and exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners. We expect Intel to continue to heavily invest substantial resources in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel's aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.\n\n\nWe also compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. In the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs. Intel could take actions that place our GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies.\n\n\nEconomic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\n\nUncertain global or regional economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, recession, slowing growth, increased unemployment, tighter credit markets, changes in fiscal monetary or trade policy, or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to stop or postpone purchases. For example, our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. During challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. Adverse changes in economic conditions could increase costs of memory, equipment, materials or substrates and other supply chain expenses. If we are not able to procure a stable supply of materials on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a supply shortage or an increase in production costs, which could negatively impact our gross margin and materially adversely affect our business. In addition, uncertain economic conditions could lead to higher borrowing costs and reduced availability of capital and credit markets, making it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty could also lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\n\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.\n\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment. Such industry-wide fluctuations may materially adversely affect us in the future.\n\n\nGlobal economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. For example, our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.\n\n\nThe growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nThe demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n\nIndustry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. We offer products that are used in different end markets and the demand for our products can vary among our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded end markets. For instance, in our Data Center segment, we offer products that are optimized for generative AI applications and in the fourth quarter of 2023, we experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for such products will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generative AI solutions in a wide variety of applications. Also, in our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments. Our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. In the past, revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. In addition, our GPU revenue in the past has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market (including potential actions by global monetary authorities), our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. The success of our semi-custom SoC products in our Gaming segment is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft. Our Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, APUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products some of which are subject to macroeconomic trends and volatile business conditions. To the extent our embedded customers are faced with higher inventory levels, they may choose to draw down their existing inventory and order less of our products. Our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023.\n\n\nThe loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, or has operations that are materially impaired for a significant period of time such that it is unable to receive or utilize our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Global health outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have and may continue to adversely affect our employees, disrupt our business operations and practices, as well those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Public health measures by government authorities such as travel bans, social-distancing, lockdown measures, vaccination requirements may cause us to incur additional costs, limit our operations, modify our business practices, diminish employee productivity or disrupt our supply chain, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent a public health crisis will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations depends on factors outside of our control, including severity, duration and the measures to contain the health outbreak.\n\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.\n\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are total cost of ownership, timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as artificial intelligence (AI)), energy efficiency relating to power consumption and battery life given their impact on total cost of ownership, reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools, completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.\n\n\nWe expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market or during challenging economic times, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing markets, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing markets, and Nvidia has added an ARM CPU offering which adds competition in the CPU market. Also, increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. While we see significant opportunity in AI, we expect intense competition from companies such as Nvidia in the supply of GPUs and other accelerators for the AI market.\n\n\nIn addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us.We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.\n\n\nFrom time to time, governments provide incentives or make other investments that could benefit and give a competitive advantage to our competitors. For example, the United States government enacted the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America and Science Act (CHIPS Act) of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the U.S. semiconductor industry. Government incentives, including the CHIPS Act, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our competitors can benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our competitors' relative position and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.\n\n\nThe profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.\n\n\nIf we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.\n\n\nWe rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us.\n\n\nFurthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the U.S. and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.\n\n\nWe have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.\n\n\nOperational and Technology Risks\n\n\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nWe utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.\n\n\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain many of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nOther risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages, or high heat events, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain environmental, social, atmospheric or natural, economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\n\nIf we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and this agreement is in place through 2025. GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for such year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025. We do not have any exclusivity commitments with GF, and we have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIf essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of IC packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of memory, equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in memory, equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another.\n\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, expand, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge manufacturing process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.\n\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.\n\n\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.\n\n\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors, product features preferences or requirements, consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, as part of our Pervasive AI strategy, we have a portfolio of hardware products and software tools to allow our customers to develop scalable and pervasive AI solutions. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into our products, but if we fail to develop and timely offer such products and technologies or keep pace with the product offerings of our competitors, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally,our efforts in developing new AI technology solutions are inherently risky and may not always succeed.We may incur significant costs, resources, investments and delays and not achieve a return on investment or capitalize on the opportunities presented by demand for AI solutions. Moreover, while AI adoption is likely to continue and may accelerate, thelong-term trajectory of this technological trend is uncertain.\n\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.\n\n\nThe revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\n\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nThe products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or results of operations.\n\n\nIT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOur business relies on technology hardware, software, cloud services, infrastructure, networks and systems (collectively, IT Systems). We own and manage some IT Systems but also rely on critical third-party IT Systems, products and services. In the ordinary course of business, we and various third-party providers and business partners process and maintain sensitive data, including personal information about workers, customers and others, as well as intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners (collectively, Confidential Data). Maintaining the availability, integrity and security of our IT Systems and Confidential Data is critical to our business and reputation. While we and others have implemented various controls and defenses, AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have been and are increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats. Threat actors range in sophistication from individual hackers and insiders to ransom gangs and state-sponsored attackers. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our IT Systems or supply chain. The increased prevalence of remote working arrangements at AMD and our providers present additional operational risks and attack vectors to our IT Systems. Our IT Systems and Confidential Data are vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity risks and threats, including malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software, compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or systems, or those of a third party, that are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. Cyberattacks have and may come into our IT Systems through the compromise of user' access credentials. Users' access credentials can be compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities.\n\n\nThreat actors are also increasingly using tools and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover from cyberattacks in a timely or effective manner. As AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cyberattacks created through AI. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. In addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such as introducing malicious code by incorporating AI generated source code. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\n\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which individually or collectively could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position; unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as intellectual property, sensitive business information or personally identifiable information (PII)); reputational harm and/or diminution in our competitiveness; loss of existing and/or future customers; litigation and/or regulatory investigations or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the diversion of management's attention and key information technology resources. In addition, many governments have enacted and are continuing to enact strict privacy and security laws, such as the UK's and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which provide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for private claims for certain types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.\n\n\nWe may encounter difficulties in operating our newly upgraded enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\n\nWe have recently upgraded our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. Our newly upgraded ERP system may not operate as we expect it to and may cause disruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Difficulties that may occur in connection with operating our newly upgraded ERP system include disruptions to business continuity, administrative or technical problems, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, and interruptions or delays to our sales processes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\n\nExcess or obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property.\n\n\nIn the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that incorporate into our software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.\n\n\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nIf we lose Microsoft Corporation's support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors' products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. We extend credit to certain of our distributors and AIB partners. If we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners or incur higher allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAdditionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.\n\n\nThese changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyberattacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.\n\n\nIn addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nIf our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nProducts as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.\n\n\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nIf we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.\n\n\nWe rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.\n\n\nOur inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the \"gray market.\" Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.\n\n\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\n\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business and the business of our suppliers and customers. Global climate change may result in certain natural disasters and climate-related events occurring with increasing frequency and severity and its physical impact on the U.S., China and other major regions where we have operations has the potential to disrupt our business and those of our customers and suppliers. Our headquarters and some of our operations and facilities are located in areasthat are susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis, wildfires, extreme storms, extreme heat, drought, freezing and other natural disasters. Water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we have facilities and where our suppliers have operations is important to our business. Certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business or those of our suppliers and customers. Global climate change may also result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. Such disruptions could cause delays in manufacturing or shipping our products, affect our supply chain and may result in the loss of business, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operation. We may also experience contractual disputes relating to supply chain delays resulting from climate change related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.Data centers depend on access to clean water and reliable energy, thus potential power or water shortages could impair our customer's ability to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\n\n\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on coverage, availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. Additionally, our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nOur business and the business of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to further climate-related regulations, contract terms and lawsuits. New increased regulations regarding carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel or energy taxes and other climate-related risks could result in greater costs; for example, as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased costs of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related expectations such as those affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections. The additional compliance costs incurred by our suppliers may be passed on to us and result in greater indirect costs to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses, impacting our reputation if there is actual or perceived non-compliance, or requiring us to alter our operations and products. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry are unclear but could be severe.\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\n\nGovernment actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.\n\n\nWe have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy, including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and emerging technologies such as AI. Further, the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIn October 2023, BIS issued new requirements for certain advanced computing items that apply to the export of products classified ECCN 3A090 or 4A090 to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, any of Country Groups D1, D4 or D5, including China. These controls prevent us from shipping our AMD Instinct\u2122 MI250, MI300X, MI300A, MI388X integrated circuits and our Versal\u2122 VC2802, VE2802 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal VC2602 and VE2602 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). In December 2023, BIS published a series of frequently asked questions indicating an intent to revise certain sections of the controls issued in October. Such revisions may bring certain other products including the AMD Instinct MI210 into the NAC notification requirement. The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring a license application before shipping a product that is the subject of a NAC notification. BIS may issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. Even new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we have no assurances BIS will agree that the alternative products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternative products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to provide services or develop products in the United States.\n\n\nWe may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. Export Administration Regulation (EAR) governs the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or provision of services, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications or Notification Advanced Computing (NAC) exception notices we have no assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will act on the filings in a timely manner. Even if BIS grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n\nIf we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.\n\n\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies.\n\n\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Many countries have started to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the \"Pillar One\" and \"Pillar Two\" proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two. Many countries, including non-EU member states, have implemented laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to review and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or existing tax rulings, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nIn addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and results of operations in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\n\nWe are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\n\n\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 17 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.\n\n\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWith respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties' intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.\n\n\nEven if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nWe are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.\n\n\nOur operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. In addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict materials), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and real property. For the manufacturing of our products, these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers' compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California and we are subject to Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites and we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. Although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities.\n\n\nFuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly. As such, the costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may increase and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications, and the like, as well as additional energy consumption limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.\n\n\nWe incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as \"conflict free.\" If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections.\n\n\nIn addition to our Company, customers, governments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance with laws and expectations. Our failure to satisfy customer expectations on forced and trafficked labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor's product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.\n\n\nIn addition, many governments have enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The GDPR imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance.\n\n\nNew emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. Given the complexity and rapid development of AI, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions such as the EU. For example, in the EU, an AI act is being considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Governments are also considering the new issues in intellectual property law that AI creates, which could result in different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and development processes and procedures and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nEvolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers.\n\n\nThere are evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters including those involving the environment and climate, energy and water consumption, diversity and inclusion, human rights and cybersecurity. This development on corporate responsibility is resulting in increased mandatory and voluntary reporting standards and disclosures. For example, various jurisdictions have adopted or are contemplating adopting legislation and regulations that may impact how we and our suppliers and customers conduct business or report on business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change-related risks and other sustainability matters related to our business. As the nature, scope and complexity of corporate responsibility reporting and disclosure requirements continue to evolve, we may incur additional compliance costs and indirect compliance costs from our customers and, suppliers that are passed on to us. In addition, certain corporate responsibility legislation and regulation may require us to adapt our business or supply chain in ways that are costly or inefficient. Emerging legal and regulatory requirements, can be unpredictable, are subject to change, and may be difficult for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. Our failure to comply, or the appearance of our failure to comply, with these legal and regulatory requirements can result in regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities, increase costs, and harm our reputation \u2013 any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, while we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or targets, among others) or commitments to improve our corporate responsibility profile and/or products or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives or achievement of such commitments may be costly, may not have the desired effect or may impact our reputation with other stakeholders and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe have publicly announced certain corporate responsibility goals spanning multiple topics informed by input from various of our stakeholders, including customers, investors and employees. These goals, which reflect our current plans and aspirations based on known conditions; thus, in the future they may change or may not be achieved. We may not achieve, for instance, our stated 30x25 energy efficiency goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency by 2025, for our processors and accelerators powering servers for high-performance computing and AI training from a 2020 baseline. We are also pursuing and annually reporting our progress toward a science-based target (aligned with a 1.5\u02daC scenario) of a 50% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, from a 2020 base year. Our achievement of these goals, aspirations and other corporate responsibility initiatives is not certain and is subject to various challenges, risks and expectations such as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve or emerge. Our progress towards some goals receive third-party limited assurance and not reasonable assurance, or may rely on receipt of others' information and data that may not be subject to either third-party limited or reasonable assurance. Any failure to achieve such goals (or achieve these goals within the set timeframe) or the perception by stakeholders of such failure to achieve these goals may result in reputational or financial harm. Simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies' efforts on certain environmental, social and sustainability-related matters. Both advocates and opponents to these matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism or litigation, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. Additionally, stakeholder groups may find our stated goals to be insufficiently responsive to the implications of issues, such as climate change, and any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet stakeholder expectations may result in loss of customers or in investors selling their shares, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIssues related to the responsible use of AI may result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and liability.\n\n\nWe offer products that include capabilities to support AI deployment and we expect this part of our business to grow. As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption of AI, and thus our business. Third-party misuse of AI applications, models, or solutions, or ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to individuals or society and impair the public's acceptance of AI. Moreover, we may be subject to competitive harm, regulatory action and legal liability as a result of new proposed legislation regulating AI, new applications of existing data protection, privacy and intellectual property and other laws. Such regulations could cause us to incur greater compliance costs and could also impact our ability to sell or the ability of our customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our AI-related products and services, which could thus require us to change our business practices and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the AI-related products that we offer have unintended consequences or unintended usage or customization by our customers or are otherwise controversial due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues the public's acceptance of AI may be impaired and may result in reputational and financial harm and liability to our business.\n\n\nMerger, Acquisition and Integration Risks\n\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and/or investments, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, may fail to materialize their anticipated benefits and could disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\n\n\nWe have acquired and invested in businesses, and may continue to do so, that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. Acquisitions or joint ventures include numerous risks includingour inability to identify suitable opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us; failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals or IP disputes or other litigation; difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all; or other unforeseen factors.Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits in a timely manner or at all for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes or operations and integrating and retaining the employees including key personnel of the acquired business; diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities, such as increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenants or other obligations; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; our inability to effectively retain suppliers, vendors and customers of the acquired businesses; entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no experience; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies' financial reporting systems. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n\nIn addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders' ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMoreover, we may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Acquisitions or joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operation and other uses which could harm our business. For example, the majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV's expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.\n\n\nFurthermore, we may at times invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Many of the instruments that we invest in are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest in are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.\n\n\nAny impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nWe account for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) and Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Risks\n\n\nThe agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\n\n\nThe indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person.\n\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the acquisition of Xilinx, we entered into supplemental indentures for the Xilinx's 2.950% Notes and 2.375% Notes (together, theAssumed Xilinx Notes), pursuant to which all obligations of Xilinx under the Assumed Xilinx Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. The indentures governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.\n\n\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe also have an unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement governing our convertible notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement contains provisions whereby a payment default or acceleration under certain agreements with respect to other material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our convertible indenture or the Revolving Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\n\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\n\nOur total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 30, 2023 was $2.5 billion. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\n\n\nWe enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.\n\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Also, our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the banking institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail.\n\n\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing.\n\n\nIn addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.\n\n\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents in accounts at certain banking institutions, and our deposits at these banking institutions may exceed insured limits. If a banking institution in which we hold funds fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds. Any such loss or lack of access to these funds could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations. Further, these events may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\n\n\nGeneral Risks\n\n\nOur worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Our shipping services are provided by third-party subcontractors. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 65% for the year ended December 30, 2023. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the U.S. and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect delivery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreover, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could have negative impacts on the global economy and financial markets.\n\n\nIn addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, sea-level rise, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara and San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. We also have operations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events and natural disasters can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. In addition, certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business or the business of our suppliers or customers. Global climate change also may result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices.\n\n\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. economy and worldwide financial markets.\n\n\nAny of the above risks, should they occur, could result in increased costs, shipment delays, general business interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.\n\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.\n\n\nOur inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.\n\n\nMuch of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry, especially in the areas of AI and machine learning, is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.\n\n\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\n\n\nOur stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.\n\n\nWe have an approved stock repurchase program that authorizes repurchases of up to $12 billion of our common stock (Repurchase Program). As of December 30, 2023, $5.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.\n\n\n39\n\n\nTable of ContentsNone.Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\n\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.\n\n\nWe design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF and AI Risk Management Framework). This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but only that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\n\n\nInformation about cybersecurity risks and our risk management processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of our overall enterprise risk management program.\n\n\nKey components of our cybersecurity risk management program include:\n\n\n\u2022risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n\n\n\u2022a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n\n\n\u2022the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes;\n\n\n\u2022cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel and senior management;\n\n\n\u2022a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n\n\n\u2022a third-party cyber risk management process for vendors including, among other things, a security assessment and contracting program for vendors based on their risk profile.\n\n\nAt this time, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.See \"Risk Factors - IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\"\n\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\n\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management's implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\n\n\nThe Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents.\n\n\nThe Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives a briefing from management on our cyber risk management program at least annually. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity matters from our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), information security team or external experts as part of the Board's continuing education on topics that impact public companies.\n\n\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur management team, led by our CISO and Sr. Director of Information Security, are responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our Sr. Director of Information Security has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 20 years and holds multiple industry-recognized certifications. Our CISO, who is also our Chief Information Officer, has over 20 years of experience managing global IT operations, including strategy, applications, infrastructure, information security, support and execution.\n\n\nOur management team, led by our CISO and Sr. Director of Information Security, is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include, among other things, briefings with internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.As of December 30, 2023, we have approximately 6 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use throughout the world. These facilities include approximately 5 million square feet of leased space and approximately 1 million square feet of owned space. Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, and we have significant operations in Austin, Texas; San Jose, California; Shanghai, China; Markham, Ontario, Canada; Longmont, Colorado; Dublin, Ireland; Singapore; and Bangalore and Hyderabad, India.

Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nDuring 2023 we successfully launched multiple leadership products across our business and made important progress on our artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. In Data Center, we launched several 4th Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 processors, including our AMD EPYC 97x4 processors, formerly codenamed \"Bergamo,\" built with our \"Zen 4c\" architecture core and designed to deliver leadership cloud-native computing, and our AMD EPYC 8004 Series processors, formerly codenamed \"Siena\", that bring the \"Zen 4c\" core into a purpose-built CPU. In addition, we announced the extension of our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processor family with six new offerings to meet the needs of general IT and mainstream computing for businesses seeking to leverage the economics of established platforms. For our AI Data Center solutions, we announced the availability of the AMD Instinct\u2122 MI300X accelerators that are designed to deliver leadership performance for generative AI workloads and high performance computing (HPC) applications. In addition, we unveiled the AMD Instinct MI300A APU, which integrate the CPU and GPU cores on a single package delivering an efficient platform while also providing the compute performance to accelerate training on the latest AI models. We enhanced the performance and features of our AMD RoCm\u2122 software by releasing our latest AMD ROCm 6 open software platform for AI and HPC workloads.\n\n\nWe expanded our Embedded processor portfolio with powerful, scalable offerings for a variety of embedded applications such as the AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded 7000 Series processor family. We launched the AMD Versal\u2122 Premium VP1902 adaptive SoC designed to help chipmakers streamline the verification of application-specific integrated circuits (SICs) and SoC designs, and we introduced the Spartan\u2122 Ultrascale+\u2122 FPGA ideal for cost-sensitive applications requiring low power and high I/O. We launched the AMD Alveo\u2122 MA35D media accelerator to power live interactive streaming services at scale, as well as the AMD Alveo UL3524 accelerator card. We expanded our Zynq\u2122 UltraScale\u2122 RFSoC digital front-end portfolio with two additional devices to enable the expansion and deployment of 4G/5G radios where lower cost, power and spectrum-efficient radios are required to address increased wireless connectivity. For our adaptive System-on-Modules (SOMs), we announced the addition of AMD Kria\u2122 K24 SOM and KD240 Drives Starter Kit which offer power-efficient compute in a small factor and target cost-sensitive industrial and commercial edge applications.\n\n\nWe continued to expand our Client product portfolio by launching our Ryzen 7000 Series Mobile processors bringing the power of \"Zen 4\" and AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics architecture to notebook users. We expanded our commercial portfolio with AMD Ryzen PRO 7000 Series Mobile processors to bring advanced and power efficient x86 processors to business notebooks and mobile workstations. We announced our Ryzen 7045HX3D gaming mobile processor with AMD 3D V-cache technology with leadership mobile gaming performance. We also introduced AMD Ryzen X3D desktop processors, the Ryzen 9 7900X3D and Ryzen 9 7950X3D processors with 3D V-Cache technology. For handheld PC gaming consoles, we introduced the AMD Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme processors featuring RDNA 3 architecture based graphics, to bring portability and battery life to handled PC gaming consoles.\n\n\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIn Gaming, we introduced the AMD Radeon RX 7900M graphics for laptops, delivering desktop-class performance for gaming and content creation. We also introduced the new AMD Radeon\u2122 PRO W7000 Series graphics, our first professional graphic cards built on advanced AMD chiplet design to deliver leadership performance and unique features: the AMD Radeon PRO W7600 and AMD Radeon PRO W7500. We designed these workstation graphics cards for mainstream professional workflows. We also unveiled the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT graphics cards optimized to deliver high-performance and high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences along with AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution 3 designed to offer performance boosts in supported games.\n\n\nWe expanded our AI engagements with a broad set of data center customers during the year. In our Data Center GPU business, demand for our Data Center GPUs products was very strong as we had large hyperscaler customers committed to deploy our next generation AMD Instinct MI300 accelerators. Our AI strategy is focused on three areas: first, to deliver a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership CPUs, GPUs and adaptive computing solutions for AI inference and training; second, to extend the open software platform we have established to enable our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and with ease; and third, expand the deep and collaborative engagements we have established across the ecosystems to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale. To help execute our AI strategy and accelerate our AI business, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to execute our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and drive development of a comprehensive software ecosystem that will span our full product portfolio. We strengthened our AI software capabilities with strategic acquisitions during the year. In August 2023, we acquired Mipsology SAS, an AI software company to help develop the full AMD AI software stack and expand the open ecosystem of software tools, libraries and models. We further expanded our open AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Nod, Inc., an open AI software company, in October 2023. Nod, Inc.'s software technology helps accelerate the deployment of AI solutions optimized for AMD Instinct data center accelerators, Ryzen AI processors, EPYC processors, Versal SoCs and Radeon GPUs.\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a mixed demand environment, net revenue for 2023 was $22.7 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to 2022 net revenue of $23.6 billion. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a 25% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor sales and a 9% decrease in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to lower semi-custom product sales. This decrease was partially offset by a 17% increase in Embedded segment revenue primarily due to the inclusion of embedded product revenue from Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) for the full twelve months period in 2023, as compared to a partial period from February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date) in the prior year period, and a 7% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by higher sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2023, was 46%, compared to 45% in 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher Embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating income for 2023 was $401 million compared to operating income of $1.3 billion for 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower Client segment performance and increased R&D investments, partially offset by lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Net income for 2023 was $854 million compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 30, 2023 were $5.8 billion, compared to $5.9 billion at the end of 2022. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion.\n\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 30, 2023, we returned a total of $985 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 9.7 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 30, 2023, $5.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\n\n\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\n\nRevenue Allowances.Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.\n\n\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.\n\n\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\n\n\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\n\n\nWe offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\n\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer's prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.\n\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\n\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nInventory Valuation.We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\n\n\nGoodwill.Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within four reporting units: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded.\n\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units' goodwill. Based on our annual qualitative impairment test, we concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\n\n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets.Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals.\n\n\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\n\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\n\n\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n\n\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThrough the end of 2023, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4\u2013Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2023 and 2022:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nNet revenue:\n\n\nData Center\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,496\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,043\n\n\nClient\n\n\n4,651\n\n\n6,201\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n6,212\n\n\n6,805\n\n\nEmbedded\n\n\n5,321\n\n\n4,552\n\n\nTotal net revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,680\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,601\n\n\nOperating income (loss):\n\n\nData Center\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,267\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,848\n\n\nClient\n\n\n(46)\n\n\n1,190\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n971\n\n\n953\n\n\nEmbedded\n\n\n2,628\n\n\n2,252\n\n\nAll Other\n\n\n(4,419)\n\n\n(4,979)\n\n\nTotal operating income\n\n\n$\n\n\n401\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,264\n\n\nData Center\n\n\nData Center net revenue of $6.5 billion in 2023 increased by 7%, compared to net revenue of $6.0 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs.\n\n\nData Center operating income was $1.3 billion in 2023, compared to operating income of $1.8 billion in 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to product mix and higher research and development (R&D) investment.\n\n\nClient\n\n\nClient net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2023 decreased by 25%, compared to net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022, primarily due to lower sales of Ryzen mobile and desktop processors, resulting from a 16% decrease in average selling price and a 12% decrease in unit shipments. Lower Ryzen processor sales were due to weak PC market conditions and inventory correction across the PC supply chain that impacted the first half of 2023.\n\n\nClient operating loss was $46 million in 2023, compared to operating income of $1.2 billion in 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue.\n\n\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGaming\n\n\nGaming net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2023 decreased by 9%, compared to net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue.\n\n\nGaming operating income was $971 million in 2023, compared to operating income of $953 million in 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by product mix, partially offset by higher R&D investment.\n\n\nEmbedded\n\n\nEmbedded net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023 increased by 17%, compared to net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022. The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of embedded product revenue from Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) for the full twelve months period in 2023, as compared to a partial period from February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date) in the prior year period.\n\n\nEmbedded operating income was $2.6 billion in 2023, compared to operating income of $2.3 billion in 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx for the full twelve months period as compared to a partial period from the Xilinx Acquisition Date in the prior year period.\n\n\nAll Other\n\n\nAll Other operating loss of $4.4 billion in 2023 primarily consisted of $2.8 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $258 million of acquisition-related and other costs. All Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense and $452 million of acquisition-related and other costs.\n\n\nComparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (expense) and Income Taxes\n\n\nThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2023 and 2022:\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\n(In millions, except for percentages)\n\n\nNet revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,680\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,601\n\n\nCost of sales\n\n\n11,278\n\n\n11,550\n\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n\n\n942\n\n\n1,448\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n10,460\n\n\n10,603\n\n\nGross margin\n\n\n46\n\n\n%\n\n\n45\n\n\n%\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n5,872\n\n\n5,005\n\n\nMarketing, general and administrative\n\n\n2,352\n\n\n2,336\n\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n\n\n1,869\n\n\n2,100\n\n\nLicensing gain\n\n\n(34)\n\n\n(102)\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n(106)\n\n\n(88)\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n197\n\n\n8\n\n\nIncome tax (benefit)\n\n\n(346)\n\n\n(122)\n\n\nGross Margin\n\n\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 46% in 2023 compared to 45% in 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher Embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue and product mix.\n\n\nExpenses\n\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n\nResearch and development expenses of $5.9 billion in 2023 increased by $867 million, or 17%, compared to $5.0 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount to support increased investment in AI.\n\n\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.4 billion in 2023 increased by $16 million, or 1%, compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs.\n\n\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.8 billion for 2023 decreased by $737 million, or 21%, compared to $3.5 billion in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the first half of the current fiscal year.\n\n\nLicensing Gain\n\n\nWe recognized $34 million of licensing gain from royalty income and $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity, in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\nInterest Expense\n\n\nInterest expense of $106 million in 2023 increased by $18 million compared to $88 million in 2022, primarily due to interest expense from our 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032(3.924% Notes) and our 4.393% Senior Notes Due 2052 (4.393% Notes) that were issued in June 2022.\n\n\nOther Income (expense), net\n\n\nOther income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n\n\nOther income (expense), net was $197 million in 2023 compared to $8 million of Other income, net in 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by rising interest rates.\n\n\nIncome Tax Benefit\n\n\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $346 million and $122 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing effective tax rates of (68%) and (10%), respectively. The increase in income tax benefit in 2023 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $185 million foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit and $169 million of research and development tax credits.\n\n\nGlobal Minimum Tax\n\n\nThe OECD is continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the \"Pillar One\" and \"Pillar Two\" proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two. Many countries, including non-EU member states, have implemented laws based on Pillar Two proposals, with effective dates starting in 2024. Although many countries have already introduced Pillar Two legislation applicable to the Company effective in 2024, certain jurisdictions in which we operate have not adopted corresponding legislation to date. The impact associated with Pillar Two will be accounted for as period costs. We continue to evaluate the impact of proposed and enacted legislative changes to our effective tax rate and cash flows as new guidance becomes available.\n\n\nInternational Sales\n\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were65%in 2023 and 66% in 2022. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.8 billion compared to $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 77% as of December 30, 2023, and 73% as of December 31, 2022.\n\n\nOur operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n\n\nOperating activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,667\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,565\n\n\nInvesting activities\n\n\n(1,423)\n\n\n1,999\n\n\nFinancing activities\n\n\n(1,146)\n\n\n(3,264)\n\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n(902)\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,300\n\n\nWe have $3.0 billion available under an unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that expires on April 29, 2027. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during the year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n\nWe also have a commercial paper program to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. We did not issue any commercial paper during the year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n\nOur aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 30, 2023. Our 2.95% Notes with a principal amount of $750 million are due in June 2024.\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $4.6 billion, of which $3.9 billion are in fiscal year 2024. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions. Our contractual obligations and purchase commitments relate primarily to our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. See Note 16 \u2013 Commitments and Guarantees.\n\n\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\nOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to our net income of $854 million in 2023, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $3.9 billion and net cash outflows of $3.0 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.3 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2023 compared to the last month of 2022, and a $580 million increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.\n\n\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products, a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals.\n\n\nInvesting Activities\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2023, which primarily consisted of cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $3.7 billion, $546 million for purchases of property and equipment, and cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $131 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $2.7 billion and sale of short-term investments of $300 million.\n\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition of Xilinx of $2.4 billion, partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.7 billion, cash used in the acquisition of Pensando Systems Inc. (\"Pensando\") of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property and equipment.\n\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2023, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $985 million under the Repurchase Program and repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $427 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $268 million.\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase Program, higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $167 million.\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n\n52\n\n\nTable of ContentsInterest Rate Risk.Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 30, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 30, 2023 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately $7 million.\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\n\n\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\n\n\nDefault Risk.We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\n\n\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 30, 2023, all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.\n\n\nForeign Exchange Risk.As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n\nThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Contents\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\nNOTE 1 \u2013The Company\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMD's products include x86 microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), as standalone devices or as incorporated into accelerated processing units (APUs), chipsets, data center and professional GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), System on Modules (SOMs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs), AI Accelerators and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\n\nNOTE 2 \u2013Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 ended on December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Fiscal 2023 and 2021 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks.\n\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation.The consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n\nReclassification.Certain immaterial prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\n\nUse of Estimates.The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company's revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\n\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which are typically net30to60days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n\nNon-custom products\n\n\nThe Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n\n\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\n\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\n\n\nCustom products\n\n\nCustom products, which are primarily associated with the Company's Gaming segment, are sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process or completed customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\n\nSales of custom products are not subject to a right of return and arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. Generally, there are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n\nDevelopment and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\n\nInventories\n\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower ofactual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\n\nThe Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made.\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.\n\n\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\n\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If a reporting unit's fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\n\n\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.\n\n\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\n\n\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n\n\nCash Equivalents\n\n\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\n\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\n\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\n\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk.\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities.The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. If an available-for-sale debt security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. The Company classifies and accounts for its short-term investments in debt securities as available-for-sale as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes. As a result, the Company classifies its short-term investments, including securities with stated maturities beyond twelve months, within current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n\nNon-marketable Equity Securities.The Company's investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available evidence, including the investee's general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee's ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee's need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\n\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\n\nThe Company's financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\n\n\nFair Value Hierarchy\n\n\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\n\nLevel 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n\nLevel 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\n\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nLevel 3 \u2014 Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\n\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of two to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\n\n\nLeases\n\n\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. When using the incremental borrowing rate, the Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's finance leases are immaterial.\n\n\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions\n\n\nThe functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\n\n\nMarketing and Advertising Expenses\n\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company's marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $695million, $683million and $578million, respectively.\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\nThe Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n\n\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nContingencies\n\n\nFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nThe Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded in the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax in the U.S. and recognizes deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years.\n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standard Updates Not Yet adopted\n\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to enhance disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for the Company's fiscal year 2024 and interim periods in fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating segment expense disclosures related to its annual report for fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. This ASU is effective for the Company's fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating income tax disclosures related to its annual report for fiscal year 2025.\n\n\nAlthough there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nNOTE 3 \u2013Supplemental Financial Statement Information\n\n\nAccounts Receivable, net\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Accounts receivable, net included unbilled accounts receivable of $1.1billion.

This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, and licensing gain. Acquisition-related and other costs primarily include transaction costs, purchase price adjustments for inventory, certain compensation charges, contract termination and workforce rebalancing charges.\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 25,2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nNet revenue:\n\n\nData Center\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,496\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,043\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,694\n\n\nClient\n\n\n4,651\n\n\n6,201\n\n\n6,887\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n6,212\n\n\n6,805\n\n\n5,607\n\n\nEmbedded\n\n\n5,321\n\n\n4,552\n\n\n246\n\n\nTotal net revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,680\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,601\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,434\n\n\nOperating income (loss):\n\n\nData Center\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,267\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,848\n\n\n$\n\n\n991\n\n\nClient\n\n\n(46)\n\n\n1,190\n\n\n2,088\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n971\n\n\n953\n\n\n934\n\n\nEmbedded\n\n\n2,628\n\n\n2,252\n\n\n44\n\n\nAll Other\n\n\n(4,419)\n\n\n(4,979)\n\n\n(409)\n\n\nTotal operating income\n\n\n$\n\n\n401\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,264\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,648\n\n\nThe following table provides items included in All Other category:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 25,2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nOperating loss:\n\n\nStock-based compensation expense\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,384\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,081\n\n\n$\n\n\n379\n\n\nAcquisition-related and other costs\n\n\n258\n\n\n452\n\n\n42\n\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n\n\n2,811\n\n\n3,548\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nLicensing gain\n\n\n(34)\n\n\n(102)\n\n\n(12)\n\n\nTotal operating loss\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,419\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,979\n\n\n$\n\n\n409\n\n\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes sales to external customers by geographic regions based on billing location of the customer:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 25,2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,837\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,049\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,656\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n4,629\n\n\n4,177\n\n\n2,381\n\n\nChina (including Hong Kong)\n\n\n3,417\n\n\n5,207\n\n\n4,096\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n2,231\n\n\n1,380\n\n\n1,389\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n2,030\n\n\n1,773\n\n\n1,249\n\n\nTaiwan\n\n\n1,841\n\n\n2,369\n\n\n2,091\n\n\nOther countries\n\n\n695\n\n\n646\n\n\n572\n\n\nTotal sales to external customers\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,680\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,601\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,434\n\n\nThe following table summarizes sales to major customers that accounted for at least 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the respective years:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nSegment\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 25,2021\n\n\nCustomer A\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n16\n\n\n%\n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\nCustomer B\n\n\nClient\n\n\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n11\n\n\n%\n\n\n*\n\n\nLess than 10%\n\n\nThe following table summarizes Property and equipment, net by geographic areas:\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,143\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,102\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n144\n\n\n132\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n86\n\n\n67\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n84\n\n\n80\n\n\nIreland\n\n\n46\n\n\n48\n\n\nChina\n\n\n42\n\n\n42\n\n\nOther countries\n\n\n44\n\n\n42\n\n\nTotal property and equipment, net\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,589\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,513\n\n\nNOTE 5 \u2013Business Combinations\n\n\nFiscal Year 2023 Acquisitions\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company completed business acquisitions for a total consideration of $134million that resulted in the recognition of $49million of identifiable net assets and $85million of goodwill.

Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $220million for the fair value of these projects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects will be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\n\n\nFrom the Pensando Acquisition Date to December 30, 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Operations include immaterial revenue and operating results attributable to Pensando, which are reported under the Data Center segment.\n\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, Pensando acquisition-related costs of $190million and $102million wasrecorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.Acquisition-related costs are primarily comprised of direct transaction costs, fair value adjustments for acquired inventory and certain compensation charges.\n\n\nXilinx Acquisition\n\n\nOn February 14, 2022 (Xilinx Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx, a leading provider of adaptive computing solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $48.8billion ($46.4billion, net of cash acquired of $2.4billion). The acquisition of Xilinx expands the Company's product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company now offers FPGAs, Adaptive SoC products and ACAP products. The purchase consideration consisted of $48.5billion of fair value of429million shares of the Company's common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders and $275million of fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to services rendered pre-combination. As the transaction closed prior to the opening of markets on the Xilinx Acquisition Date, the fair value of the common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders was based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 11, 2022 of $113.18per share.\n\n\nThe financial results of Xilinx are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the Xilinx Acquisition Date to December 30, 2023 and are reported under the Embedded and Data Center segments.\n\n\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe purchase consideration was allocated as follows:\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,366\n\n\nShort-term investments\n\n\n1,582\n\n\nAccounts receivable\n\n\n299\n\n\nInventories\n\n\n539\n\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n\n61\n\n\nProperty and equipment\n\n\n692\n\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n\n61\n\n\nAcquisition-related intangibles\n\n\n27,308\n\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\n\n15\n\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n\n418\n\n\nTotal Assets\n\n\n33,341\n\n\nAccounts payable\n\n\n116\n\n\nAccrued liabilities\n\n\n634\n\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n\n185\n\n\nLong-term debt\n\n\n1,474\n\n\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n\n\n45\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities\n\n\n4,346\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n532\n\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\n\n7,332\n\n\nFair value of net assets acquired\n\n\n26,009\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n22,784\n\n\nTotal purchase consideration\n\n\n$\n\n\n48,793\n\n\nThe Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimates of their fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management.

Instruments\n\n\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\n\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 24 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional value of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $2.4billion and $1.9billion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was recorded as an asset of $6million as of December 30, 2023 and as a liability of $27million as of December 31, 2022.\n\n\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $568million and $485million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n\nThe cash flows associated with derivative instruments as cash flow hedging instruments are classified in the same category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related items.\n\n\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNOTE 10 \u2013Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities, equity investments and trade receivables.\n\n\nThe Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\n\n\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately13% and18% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from this customer represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\n\n\nNOTE 11 \u2013Earnings Per Share\n\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.\n\n\nDiluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company's stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants.\n\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n\n\nNumerator\n\n\nNet income for basic earnings per share\n\n\n$\n\n\n854\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,320\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,162\n\n\nDenominator\n\n\nBasic weighted-average shares\n\n\n1,614\n\n\n1,561\n\n\n1,213\n\n\nEffect of potentially dilutive shares from employee equity plans and warrants\n\n\n11\n\n\n10\n\n\n16\n\n\nDiluted weighted-average shares\n\n\n1,625\n\n\n1,571\n\n\n1,229\n\n\nEarnings per share:\n\n\nBasic\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.61\n\n\nDiluted\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.57\n\n\nPotential shares from employee equity plans totaling6million,16million and2million weighted-average shares for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\n\n\n79\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNOTE 12 \u2013Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation\n\n\nCommon Stock\n\n\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 25,2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nBalance, beginning of period\n\n\n1,612\n\n\n1,207\n\n\n1,211\n\n\nCommon stock issued in the acquisition of Xilinx\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n429\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nCommon stock issued under employee equity plans\n\n\n17\n\n\n17\n\n\n12\n\n\nRepurchases of common stock\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n(36)\n\n\n(17)\n\n\nCommon stock repurchases for tax withholding on equity awards\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nIssuance of common stock upon warrant exercise\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nIssuance of common stock to settle convertible debt\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n3\n\n\nBalance, end of period\n\n\n1,616\n\n\n1,612\n\n\n1,207\n\n\nStock Repurchase Program\n\n\nThe Company has an approved stock repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $12 billion of the Company's common stock (Repurchase Program). During the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company repurchased9.7million shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program for $985million. As of December 30, 2023, $5.6billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\nThe Company's employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On May 18, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the AMD 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), which supersedes the AMD 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Plans). Outstanding awards granted under the Prior Plans will continue to be governed by the terms of the Prior Plans but no awards may be made under the Prior Plans on or after May 18, 2023. Under the 2023 Plan, 87,645,874 shares of the Company's common stock are reserved and available for delivery pursuant to awards granted under the 2023 Plan. Generally, stock options granted under the 2023 Plan vest and become exercisable over afour-yearperiod from the date of grant and expire withinseven yearsafter the grant date. Unvested shares from the 2023 Plan that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2023 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.\n\n\nStock Options.Under the 2023 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2023 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\n\n\nTime-based RSUs.Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company's common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.\n\n\nPRSUs.PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company's senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company's financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from0% to250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.\n\n\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nESPP.Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to15% of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of thesix-monthoffering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year.\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company had74million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and37million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2023 Plan and the Prior Plans.\n\n\nValuation and Expense\n\n\nStock-based compensation expense was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nCost of sales\n\n\n$\n\n\n30\n\n\n$\n\n\n29\n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n1,002\n\n\n697\n\n\n246\n\n\nMarketing, general, and administrative\n\n\n352\n\n\n355\n\n\n128\n\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense before income taxes\n\n\n1,384\n\n\n1,081\n\n\n379\n\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\n\n(249)\n\n\n(179)\n\n\n(58)\n\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,135\n\n\n$\n\n\n902\n\n\n$\n\n\n321\n\n\nStock Options.The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $53.72, $44.35and $46.07per share, respectively, using the following assumptions:\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\nExpected volatility\n\n\n52.36% - 52.42%\n\n\n51.28\n\n\n%\n\n\n51.77\n\n\n%\n\n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n\n3.93% -4.11%\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n%\n\n\n0.69\n\n\n%\n\n\nExpected dividends\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\nExpected life (in years)\n\n\n4.96-5.04\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n4.55\n\n\nThe Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company's common stock as the expected volatility assumption.

The increase in income tax benefit in 2023 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $185million FDII tax benefit and $169million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\n\n\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2023 and 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit.\n\n\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss in Singapore, the Company did not receive any income tax or earnings per share benefit.\n\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows:\n\n\n84\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\n\nNet operating loss carryovers\n\n\n$\n\n\n992\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,031\n\n\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n\n\n574\n\n\n835\n\n\nEmployee benefits not currently deductible\n\n\n302\n\n\n214\n\n\nFederal and state tax credit carryovers\n\n\n660\n\n\n631\n\n\nForeign R&D and investment tax credits\n\n\n597\n\n\n578\n\n\nForeign tax credits\n\n\n71\n\n\n46\n\n\nLease liability\n\n\n181\n\n\n161\n\n\nCapitalized R&D\n\n\n1,753\n\n\n943\n\n\nOther\n\n\n96\n\n\n104\n\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n\n5,226\n\n\n4,543\n\n\nLess: valuation allowance\n\n\n(2,124)\n\n\n(2,078)\n\n\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n\n3,102\n\n\n2,465\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\n\nAcquired intangibles\n\n\n(3,104)\n\n\n(3,430)\n\n\nRight-of-use assets\n\n\n(175)\n\n\n(151)\n\n\nGILTI\n\n\n(524)\n\n\n(633)\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(135)\n\n\n(127)\n\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n\n(3,938)\n\n\n(4,341)\n\n\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(836)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,876)\n\n\nAs a result of the R&D capitalization tax law that became effective in 2022, the capitalization of R&D expense amounts resulted in increased taxable income in 2023 and 2022. The capitalized R&D will be amortized and become deductible in future periods.Therefore, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.\n\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in 2022, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability.\n\n\nThe movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nBalance at beginning of year\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,078\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,735\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,576\n\n\nCharges to income tax expense and other accounts\n\n\n41\n\n\n112\n\n\n3\n\n\nAcquisition-related\n\n\n5\n\n\n231\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nNet recoveries+\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n156\n\n\nBalance at end of year\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,124\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,078\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,735\n\n\n+\n\n\nThe net recoveries in 2021 were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits.\n\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2023, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state net operating losses (NOLs) carryforwards as of December 30, 2023, were $295million and $343million, respectively. NOLs may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $46 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2024 and 2037, and $249 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date. State NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company's balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company's tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12million will expire at various dates between 2037 and 2042. The state tax return credits of $757million will expire at various dates between 2024 and 2039, except for the California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $624million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2027 and 2042.\n\n\nIn 2022, the Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx's cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.\n\n\nAreconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nBalance at beginning of year\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,361\n\n\n$\n\n\n275\n\n\n$\n\n\n119\n\n\nIncreases for tax positions taken in the current year\n\n\n53\n\n\n748\n\n\n156\n\n\nIncreases for tax positions taken in prior years\n\n\n57\n\n\n104\n\n\n14\n\n\nDecreases for tax positions taken in prior years\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n(9)\n\n\nIncreases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n252\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDecreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nBalance at end of year\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,463\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,361\n\n\n$\n\n\n275\n\n\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $1.3billion, $1.2billion and $215million as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The Company had $142 million, $81 million and $35 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4billion and $1.3billion, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from2008are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS. It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain.\n\n\nUnder current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. There were no cumulative undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes as of December 30, 2023.\n\n\n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNOTE 15 \u2013Other Income (Expense), Net\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of Other income (expense), net:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n$\n\n\n206\n\n\n$\n\n\n65\n\n\n$\n\n\n8\n\n\nLoss on debt redemption, repurchase and conversion\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nGains (losses) on equity investments, net\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(62)\n\n\n56\n\n\nOther income (expense)\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n5\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n$\n\n\n197\n\n\n$\n\n\n8\n\n\n$\n\n\n55\n\n\nNOTE 16 \u2013Commitments and Guarantees\n\n\nOperating Leases\n\n\nThe Company has entered into operating and finance leases for its corporate offices, data centers, research and development facilities and certain equipment.

For 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $46million and $40million, respectively, of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases.

The Company may also offeronetothree-yearlimited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products.\n\n\nChanges in the Company's estimated liability for product warranty during 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n\nDecember 30,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n65\n\n\n$\n\n\n51\n\n\nProvisions during the period\n\n\n126\n\n\n115\n\n\nSettlements during the period\n\n\n(106)\n\n\n(101)\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n85\n\n\n$\n\n\n65\n\n\nIn addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company's products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial.\n\n\nNOTE 17 \u2013Contingencies\n\n\nLitigation and Other Legal Matters\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, there were no material legal proceedings.\n\n\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on management's current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\n\nThe Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders forthreesites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at thesethreesites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\n\n\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to thethreesites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\n\n\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4.8million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material.\n\n\n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\n90\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nInventory Valuation\n\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\n\nAt December 30, 2023, the Company's net inventory balance was $4,351 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand, and by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated demand.\n\n\nAuditing management's inventory excess and obsolescence reserves involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In estimating excess and obsolescence reserves, management developed certain assumptions, including forecasted demand which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory excess and obsolescence reserves estimation process, including the basis for developing the above-described assumptions and management's judgments.\n\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management's key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of excess and obsolescence reserves. We compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management's adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management's historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted demand used by management to determine necessary changes in the inventory excess and obsolescence reserves.\n\n\n/s/Ernst & Young LLP\n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1970.\n\n\nSan Jose, California\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\n\n91\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n92\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\n\nSan Jose, California\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\n\n93\n\n\nTable of ContentsNone.Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n\n1.Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\n\n2.Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\n\n3.Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.\n\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\n\n\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled \"Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\" published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we completed the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. In connection with this implementation, we modified the design and documentation of our internal control processes and procedures relating to the new system. Following the implementation, the changes to our control environment were validated according to our established processes and our internal controls over financial reporting continued to operate as designed. There were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.During the quarterly period ended December 30, 2023, the following directors and officers adopted, modified or terminated 10b5-1 plans:\n\n\nName\n\n\nTitle of Director or Officer\n\n\nAction\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTrading Arrangement\n\n\nTotal Shares to be Sold\n\n\nExpiration Date\n\n\nRule 10b5-1*\n\n\nNon-Rule 10b5\u20111**\n\n\nLisa Su\n\n\nChair, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\nAdopt\n\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\n\nX\n\n\n834,226\n\n\nDecember 5, 2024\n\n\nMark Papermaster\n\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer\n\n\nAdopt\n\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\n\nX\n\n\n97,756\n\n\nNovember 15, 2024\n\n\n* Intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c)** Not intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c)Not applicable.\n\n\n95\n\n\nTable of ContentsThe information under the captions \"Item 1\u2014Election of Directors\" (including \"Consideration of Stockholder Nominees for Director\"), \"Corporate Governance,\" \"Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors,\" \"Executive Officers\" and \"Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\" in our proxy statement for our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (our 2024 Proxy Statement) is incorporated herein by reference.

We assess our programs annually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.\n\n\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and practices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to sustainability.\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\n\n\nIn May 2023, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2025. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase\n\n\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nor generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. In fiscal year 2023, we increased the percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA's scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\n\n\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the Green500 list.\n\n\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\n\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were engaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies relating to human capital management.\n\n\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\n\n\nRecruitment\n\n\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in global female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee referrals.\n\n\nDevelopment and Retention\n\n\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\n\n\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\n\n\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall turnover rate was 2.7%.\n\n\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\n\n\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company's future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.\n\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees' and their families' physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community Resource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents.\n\n\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families.\n\n\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\n\n\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.\n\n\nWhen recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\n\n\nTo this end, we have been:\n\n\n\u2022Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\n\n\n\u2022Embedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and find internal opportunities;\n\n\n\u2022Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;\n\n\n\u2022Providing peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\n\n\n\u2022Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity;\n\n\n\u2022Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\n\n\n\u2022Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\n\n\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\n\n\nFlexible Working Environment\n\n\nWe support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under certain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work.\n\n\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days off a quarter for employees to rest and recharge.\n\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\n\n\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages, and positions as of February 16, 2024:\n\n\nName\n\n\nAge\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang\n\n\n60\n\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\nColette M.

Our web site and the information on it or connected to it are not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\n\nRisk Factors Summary\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\n\n\n\u2022Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry may adversely impact our financial results.\n\n\n\u2022Competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\n\n\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\n\n\n\u2022Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\n\n\u2022Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\n\n\n\u2022Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and could damage our business.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\n\n\u2022Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n\n\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\n\n\n\u2022Product, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, stock price and reputation.\n\n\n\u2022Business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\n\n\n\u2022Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\n\n\u2022We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully integrate acquisition targets.\n\n\n\u2022A significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to end customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these end customers.\n\n\n\u2022We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees.\n\n\n\u2022Modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\n\n\n\u2022Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\n\n\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\n\n\n\u2022We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely impact our business.\n\n\n\u2022Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in financial, reputational, or operational harm and liability.\n\n\n\u2022Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\n\n\u2022Adequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\n\n\u2022We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\n\n\n\u2022Our operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates, changes in tax laws, and other tax-related factors.\n\n\n\u2022Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory proceedings.\n\n\n\u2022Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\n\n\u2022Delaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.\n\n\nRisk Factors\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\n\n\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\n\n\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards.\n\n\nOur success depends on our ability to:\n\n\n\u2022timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;\n\n\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\n\n\n\u2022launch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\n\n\n\u2022expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\n\n\n\u2022meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;\n\n\n\u2022manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;\n\n\n\u2022develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and\n\n\n\u2022complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.\n\n\nWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed.\n\n\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other software solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\n\n\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\n\n\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors' products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\n\n\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\n\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\n\n\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient\n\n\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\n\n\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\n\n\n\u2022changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n\n\n\u2022competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\n\n\u2022changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\n\n\u2022sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n\n\n\u2022rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\n\u2022the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\n\n\n\u2022new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\n\n\u2022new or unexpected end-use cases;\n\n\n\u2022increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n\n\u2022business decisions made by third parties;\n\n\n\u2022the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services;\n\n\n\u2022changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n\n\n\u2022the demand for our products; or\n\n\n\u2022government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\n\n\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements.  Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong.  We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\n\n\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\n\n\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\n\n\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\n\n\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\n\n\nIf we overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\n\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\n\n\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\n\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our\n\n\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \"gray market,\" which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\n\n\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\n\n\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\n\n\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n\n\u2022lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n\n\n\u2022failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;\n\n\n\u2022failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;\n\n\n\u2022failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\n\n\n\u2022limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers;\n\n\n\u2022loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\n\n\n\u2022lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\n\n\n\u2022suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\n\n\n\u2022delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors' or other customers' orders over ours;\n\n\n\u2022requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\n\n\n\u2022low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry's proprietary process technology; and\n\n\n\u2022disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.\n\n\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share.\n\n\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products we or our partners offer rely on\n\n\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ntraining data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\n\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\n\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n\n\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\n\n\u2022increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\n\n\n\u2022increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\n\n\n\u2022decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\n\n\n\u2022the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers' or our licensees' inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\n\n\n\u2022limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n\n\n\u2022the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on;\n\n\n\u2022reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\n\n\n\u2022increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\n\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our customers' ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors' ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\n\n\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\n\n\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\n\n\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. Although we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\n\n\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\n\n\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\n\n\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\n\n\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners' supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate third-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the\n\n\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\npast and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\n\n\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\n\n\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business.\n\n\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\n\n\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\n\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n\n\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\n\n\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\n\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\n\n\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\n\n\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\n\n\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\n\n\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been\n\n\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nharmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\n\n\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\u2022difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\n\n\n\u2022assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\n\n\u2022integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\n\n\u2022coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\n\n\u2022stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n\n\n\u2022potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\n\n\n\u2022the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\n\n\u2022the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\n\n\u2022negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\n\n\u2022exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n\n\n\u2022impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's employees, vendors and customers.\n\n\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\n\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners' or customers' purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the\n\n\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCompute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries' trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\n\n\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry's highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.\n\n\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\n\n\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\n\n\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\n\n\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\n\n\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\u2022our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n\n\n\u2022our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n\n\n\u2022our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;\n\n\n\u2022our vendors' payment requirements;\n\n\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\n\n\n\u2022changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\n\n\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n\n\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\n\n\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\n\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\n\n\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\n\n\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated\n\n\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\n\n\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\n\n\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n\n\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or \"NAC,\" process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\n\n\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\n\n\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\n\n\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \"design-out\" certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\n\n\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\n\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder,\n\n\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nregulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\n\n\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to the Biden administration's Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify the USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\n\n\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\n\n\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party's IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party's IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\n\n\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\n\n\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\n\n\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard\n\n\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\n\n\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\n\n\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of \"Standard Contractual Clauses\" designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.'s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China's law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China's law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR's cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\n\n\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\n\n\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\n\n\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\n\n\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\n\n\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules announced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n\n\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\n\n\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\n\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\n\n\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.\n\n\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared\n\n\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nimmediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.\n\n\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.\n\n\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Not applicable.Risk management and strategy\n\n\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\n\n\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\n\n\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers' conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\n\n\nRefer to \"Item 1A. Risk factors\" in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about cybersecurity-related risks.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nInformation security matters, including managing and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats, remain under the oversight of the Company's Board of Directors, or the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's information security policies and practices and the internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information security updates from management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team. The Board also receives annual reports on information security matters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.\n\n\nOur security efforts are managed by a team of executive cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal professionals. We have established a cross-functional leadership team, consisting of executive-level leaders, that meets regularly to review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats. With oversight and guidance provided by the cross-functional leadership team, our information security teams refine our practices to address emerging security risks and changes in regulations. Our executive-level leadership team also participates in cybersecurity incident response efforts by engaging with the incident response team and helping direct the company's response to and assessment of certain cybersecurity incidents.\n\n\nWe have designated a Chief Security Officer that reports to our Senior Vice President of Software Engineering to manage our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Security Officer's cybersecurity expertise includes over 17 years of combined government and private sector assignments.\n\n\n31\n\n\nTable of ContentsOur headquarters is in Santa Clara, California. We own and lease approximately 3 million square feet of office and building space for our corporate headquarters. In addition, we lease data center space in Santa Clara, California. We also own and lease facilities for data centers, research and development, and/or sales and administrative purposes throughout the U.S. and in various international locations, primarily in China, India, Israel, and Taiwan. We believe our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.

Risk Factors\", our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOur Company and Our Businesses\n\n\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\n\n\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n\n\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\n\n\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong.  We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\n\n\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.\n\n\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\n\n\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\n\n\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGlobal Trade\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n\n\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\n\n\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.\n\n\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\" for a discussion of this potential impact.\n\n\nMacroeconomic Factors\n\n\nMacroeconomic factors, including\u202finflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n\n\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\n\n\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n\n\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Summary\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nChange\n\n\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n60,922\n\n\n$\n\n\n26,974\n\n\nUp 126%\n\n\nGross margin\n\n\n72.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n56.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nUp 15.8 pts\n\n\nOperating expenses\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,329\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,132\n\n\nUp 2%\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,972\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,224\n\n\nUp 681%\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n$\n\n\n29,760\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,368\n\n\nUp 581%\n\n\nNet income per diluted share\n\n\n$\n\n\n11.93\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.74\n\n\nUp 586%\n\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\n\n\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago.\n\n\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer internet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare. Customers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data Center compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year.\n\n\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand.\n\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%.\n\n\nAutomotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving platforms.\n\n\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.\n\n\nOperating expenses increased for fiscal year 2024, driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Fiscal year 2023 also included a $1.4 billion acquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction.\n\n\nMarket Platform Highlights\n\n\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\n\n\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. We announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine for Games, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform games and launched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. Additionally, we released TensorRT-LLM for Windows and launched GeForce RTX 40-Series SUPER GPUs. Gaming reached a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games and applications utilizing NVIDIA DLSS, ray tracing and other NVIDIA RTX technologies.\n\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.6 billion, up 1% from fiscal year 2023. In Professional Visualization, we announced new GPUs based on the NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace architecture, and announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, for the development and deployment of industrial metaverse applications.\n\n\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 21% from fiscal year 2023. In Automotive, we announced a partnership with MediaTek, which will develop mainstream automotive systems on chips for global OEMs integrating a new NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics. We furthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-generation\n\n\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nelectric vehicles, and announced further adoption of NVIDIA DRIVE platform with BYD, XPENG, GWM, Li Auto, ZEEKR and Xiaomi.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\n\nInventories\n\n\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\n\n\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\n\n\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\n\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\n\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nRevenue Allowances\n\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\n\n\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\n\n\nLicense and Development Arrangements\n\n\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\n\n\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\n\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\n\n\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\n\n\nChange in Accounting Estimate\n\n\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n\n\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nCost of revenue\n\n\n27.3\n\n\n43.1\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n72.7\n\n\n56.9\n\n\nOperating expenses\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n27.2\n\n\nSales, general and administrative\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n9.1\n\n\nAcquisition termination cost\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n5.0\n\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n18.6\n\n\n41.3\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n54.1\n\n\n15.6\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n(0.1)\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n(0.1)\n\n\nIncome before income tax\n\n\n55.5\n\n\n15.5\n\n\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n48.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nReportable Segments\n\n\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n$Change\n\n\n%Change\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\nCompute & Networking\n\n\n$\n\n\n47,405\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,068\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,337\n\n\n215\n\n\n%\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n13,517\n\n\n11,906\n\n\n1,611\n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n60,922\n\n\n$\n\n\n26,974\n\n\n$\n\n\n33,948\n\n\n126\n\n\n%\n\n\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n$Change\n\n\n%Change\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\nCompute & Networking\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,016\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,083\n\n\n$\n\n\n26,933\n\n\n530\n\n\n%\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n5,846\n\n\n4,552\n\n\n1,294\n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\nAll Other\n\n\n(4,890)\n\n\n(5,411)\n\n\n521\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,972\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,224\n\n\n$\n\n\n28,748\n\n\n681\n\n\n%\n\n\nCompute & Networking revenue\u2013 The year-on-year increase was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand.\n\n\nGraphics revenue\u2013 The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels.\n\n\nReportable segment operating income\u2013 The year-on-year increase in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.\n\n\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAll Other operating loss- The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nConcentration of Revenue\n\n\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors.\n\n\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\n\n\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\n\n\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\n\n\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\n\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\n\n\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.\n\n\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n$Change\n\n\n%Change\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\nResearch and development expenses\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,675\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,339\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,336\n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n% of net revenue\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n27.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nSales, general and administrative expenses\n\n\n2,654\n\n\n2,440\n\n\n214\n\n\n9\n\n\n%\n\n\n% of net revenue\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n%\n\n\nAcquisition termination cost\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1,353\n\n\n(1,353)\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n% of net revenue\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,329\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,132\n\n\n$\n\n\n197\n\n\n2\n\n\n%\n\n\n% of net revenue\n\n\n18.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n41.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2024 was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\n\n\nAcquisition Termination Cost\n\n\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\n\n\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n$Change\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n$\n\n\n866\n\n\n$\n\n\n267\n\n\n$\n\n\n599\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n(257)\n\n\n(262)\n\n\n5\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n237\n\n\n(48)\n\n\n285\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n$\n\n\n846\n\n\n$\n\n\n(43)\n\n\n$\n\n\n889\n\n\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was due to higher yields on higher cash balances.\n\n\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\n\n\nOther, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by changes in value from our non-affiliated investments. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 and income tax benefit of $187 million for fiscal year 2023. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year 2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\n\n\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\n\n\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\n\n\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for a new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two legislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on Pillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\n\n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,280\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,389\n\n\nMarketable securities\n\n\n18,704\n\n\n9,907\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n\n\n$\n\n\n25,984\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,296\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n28,090\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,641\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n(10,566)\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,375\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n(13,633)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(11,617)\n\n\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in revenue. Accounts receivable balance in fiscal year 2024 reflected $557 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date.\n\n\nCash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities and higher purchases of marketable securities.\n\n\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to a debt repayment and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share repurchases.\n\n\nLiquidity\n\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year 2025 and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\n\n\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we expect to use our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion related to property and equipment.\n\n\nExcept for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of fiscal year 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\n\n\nCapital Return to Shareholders\n\n\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends.\n\n\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\n\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0 billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7 billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our\n\n\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncommon stock up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\n\n\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022 which was not material for fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\n\n\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 28, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nDue in one year\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,250\n\n\nDue in one to five years\n\n\n2,250\n\n\nDue in five to ten years\n\n\n2,750\n\n\nDue in greater than ten years\n\n\n3,500\n\n\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\n\n\n(41)\n\n\nNet carrying amount\n\n\n9,709\n\n\nLess short-term portion\n\n\n(1,250)\n\n\nTotal long-term portion\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,459\n\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\n\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\n\n\nFor a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.\n\n\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.3 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $140 million, recorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.\n\n\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.Investment and Interest Rate Risk\n\n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of our businesses.\n\n\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments of $93 million.\n\n\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $9.7 billion of senior Notes net outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no\n\n\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nfinancial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\n\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs.\n\n\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $116 million and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\n\n\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\n\n\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.The information required by this Item is set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.None.Controls and Procedures\n\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nBased on their evaluation as of January 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.\n\n\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024 based on the criteria set forth inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth inInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2024.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our\n\n\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nexisting core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.OnDecember 18, 2023,John O.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\n\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company's inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company's inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company's consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company's consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management's approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n\nSan Jose,

and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\nOur Company\n\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n\nAll references to \"NVIDIA,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\" mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\n\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n\nUse of Estimates\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\n\n\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment fromthreetofourorfive years, and our assembly and test equipment fromfivetoseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33million and $102million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135million and net income of $114million after tax, or $0.05per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n\n\nProduct Sales Revenue\n\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\n\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n\n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nLicense and Development Arrangements\n\n\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\n\nSoftware Licensing\n\n\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\n\n\nCloud Services\n\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\n\n\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\n\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\n\n\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\n\n\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\n\n\nProduct Warranties\n\n\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging fromonetothree yearsfor products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\n\nStock-based Compensation\n\n\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\n\n\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\n\n\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\n\n\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\n\n\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\n\n\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\n\nNet Income Per Share\n\n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\n\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or\n\n\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nwe intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\n\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\n\n\nInventories\n\n\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\n\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ofthreetoseven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up tothirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n\nLeases\n\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\n\n\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\n\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\n\n\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\n\n\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n\n\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\n\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging fromonetotwenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\n\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\n\n\nBusiness Combination\n\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\n\n\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\n\n\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and changes to income tax disclosures including disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments in the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual period beginning fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nNote 2 -Business Combination\n\n\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\n\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.4billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\n\n\nNote 3 -Leases\n\n\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and 2035.\n\n\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 28, 2024, are as follows:\n\n\nOperating Lease Obligations\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nFiscal Year:\n\n\n2025\n\n\n$\n\n\n290\n\n\n2026\n\n\n270\n\n\n2027\n\n\n253\n\n\n2028\n\n\n236\n\n\n2029\n\n\n202\n\n\n2030 and thereafter\n\n\n288\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n1,539\n\n\nLess imputed interest\n\n\n192\n\n\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments\n\n\n1,347\n\n\nLess short-term operating lease liabilities\n\n\n228\n\n\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,119\n\n\nIn addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence within fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of1to10years for $1.1billion.\n\n\nOperating lease expenses for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $269million, $193million, $168million, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n\n\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\n\n\nEquity Incentive Program\n\n\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\n\n\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\n\n\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.\n\n\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 28, 2024, up to37million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28, 2024, there were147million shares available for future grants.\n\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over afour-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over athree-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over afour-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over afour-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest100% on about thethree-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\n\n\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\n\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\n\n\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about24months, divided intofourpurchase periods ofsix months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 28, 2024, we had227million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n\n\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nEquity Award Activity\n\n\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\n\n\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\n\n\nNumber of Shares\n\n\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\n\n\n(In millions, except per share data)\n\n\nBalances, Jan 29, 2023\n\n\n45\n\n\n$\n\n\n158.45\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n14\n\n\n$\n\n\n374.08\n\n\nVested restricted stock\n\n\n(21)\n\n\n$\n\n\n148.56\n\n\nCanceled and forfeited\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n206.35\n\n\nBalances, Jan 28, 2024\n\n\n37\n\n\n$\n\n\n245.94\n\n\nVested and expected to vest after Jan 28, 2024\n\n\n37\n\n\n$\n\n\n245.49\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, there were147million and160million shares, respectively, of common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\n\n\nThe total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 28, 2024, January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022, was $8.2billion, $4.3billion, and $5.6billion, respectively.\n\n\nNote 5 -Net Income Per Share\n\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n\n(In millions, except per share data)\n\n\nNumerator:\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n$\n\n\n29,760\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,368\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,752\n\n\nDenominator:\n\n\nBasic weighted average shares\n\n\n2,469\n\n\n2,487\n\n\n2,496\n\n\nDilutive impact of outstanding equity awards\n\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n\n39\n\n\nDiluted weighted average shares\n\n\n2,494\n\n\n2,507\n\n\n2,535\n\n\nNet income per share:\n\n\nBasic (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n12.05\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.76\n\n\n$\n\n\n3.91\n\n\nDiluted (2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n11.93\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.74\n\n\n$\n\n\n3.85\n\n\nEquity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive\n\n\n15\n\n\n40\n\n\n21\n\n\n(1)    Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n\n\n(2)    Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\n\n\nNote 6 -Goodwill\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances allocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $4.1billion and $370million, respectively.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearingen bancof the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's\n\n\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nresolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA's deadline to file a petition for a writ of certiorari is March 4, 2024.\n\n\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. Following the Ninth Circuit's denial of NVIDIA's petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties are conferring regarding the next steps in this derivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.\n\n\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit's denial of NVIDIA's petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties are conferring regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\n\n\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\n\n\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n\n\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nNote 14 -Income Taxes\n\n\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nCurrent income taxes:\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,710\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,703\n\n\n$\n\n\n482\n\n\nState\n\n\n335\n\n\n46\n\n\n42\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n502\n\n\n228\n\n\n71\n\n\nTotal current\n\n\n6,547\n\n\n1,977\n\n\n595\n\n\nDeferred income taxes:\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n(2,499)\n\n\n(2,165)\n\n\n(420)\n\n\nState\n\n\n(206)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n216\n\n\n1\n\n\n14\n\n\nTotal deferred\n\n\n(2,489)\n\n\n(2,164)\n\n\n(406)\n\n\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,058\n\n\n$\n\n\n(187)\n\n\n$\n\n\n189\n\n\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\n$\n\n\n29,495\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,477\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,446\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n4,323\n\n\n704\n\n\n1,495\n\n\nIncome before income tax\n\n\n$\n\n\n33,818\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,181\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,941\n\n\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows:\n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n\n(In millions, except percentages)\n\n\nTax expense computed at federal statutory rate\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,102\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n878\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,088\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\n\n\nState income taxes, net of federal tax effect\n\n\n120\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n50\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n42\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nForeign-derived intangible income\n\n\n(1,408)\n\n\n(4.2)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(739)\n\n\n(17.7)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(520)\n\n\n(5.2)\n\n\n%\n\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n\n(741)\n\n\n(2.2)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(309)\n\n\n(7.4)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(337)\n\n\n(3.4)\n\n\n%\n\n\nForeign tax rate differential\n\n\n(467)\n\n\n(1.4)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(83)\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(497)\n\n\n(5.0)\n\n\n%\n\n\nU.S. federal research and development tax credit\n\n\n(431)\n\n\n(1.3)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(278)\n\n\n(6.6)\n\n\n%\n\n\n(289)\n\n\n(2.9)\n\n\n%\n\n\nAcquisition termination cost\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n261\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\nIP domestication\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n(244)\n\n\n(2.5)\n\n\n%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(117)\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\n%\n\n\n33\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n(54)\n\n\n(0.5)\n\n\n%\n\n\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,058\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n(187)\n\n\n(4.5)\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n189\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\n\nCapitalized research and development expenditure\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,376\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,859\n\n\nGILTI deferred tax assets\n\n\n1,576\n\n\n800\n\n\nAccruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes\n\n\n1,121\n\n\n686\n\n\nResearch and other tax credit carryforwards\n\n\n936\n\n\n951\n\n\nNet operating loss and capital loss carryforwards\n\n\n439\n\n\n409\n\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n\n\n263\n\n\n193\n\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n\n106\n\n\n99\n\n\nProperty, equipment and intangible assets\n\n\n4\n\n\n66\n\n\nOther deferred tax assets\n\n\n179\n\n\n91\n\n\nGross deferred tax assets\n\n\n8,000\n\n\n5,154\n\n\nLess valuation allowance\n\n\n(1,552)\n\n\n(1,484)\n\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n\n6,448\n\n\n3,670\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\n\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n\n\n(502)\n\n\n(228)\n\n\nOperating lease assets\n\n\n(255)\n\n\n(179)\n\n\nAcquired intangibles\n\n\n(74)\n\n\n(115)\n\n\nGross deferred tax liabilities\n\n\n(831)\n\n\n(522)\n\n\nNet deferred tax asset (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,617\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,148\n\n\n(1)  Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $6.1billion and $3.4billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $462million and $247million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.1billion and $250million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6billion and $1.5billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\n\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $315million, $342million and $361million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $361million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $31million, before the impact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.6billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $1.5billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $75million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.4billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025.\n\n\nOur tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied before utilization.\n\n\n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,238\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,013\n\n\n$\n\n\n776\n\n\nIncreases in tax positions for current year\n\n\n616\n\n\n268\n\n\n246\n\n\nIncreases in tax positions for prior years\n\n\n87\n\n\n1\n\n\n14\n\n\nDecreases in tax positions for prior years\n\n\n(148)\n\n\n(15)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nSettlements\n\n\n(104)\n\n\n(9)\n\n\n(8)\n\n\nLapse in statute of limitations\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n(11)\n\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,670\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,238\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,013\n\n\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2024 are $1.0billion of tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.\n\n\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\n\n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our consolidated statements of income of $42million, $33million, and $14million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we have accrued $140million and $95million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\n\n\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 28, 2024, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\n\n\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 28, 2024, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal years after 2020, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal years 2005 through 2023. As of January 28, 2024, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2005 through 2023.\n\n\nNote 15 -Shareholders' Equity\n\n\nCapital Return Program\n\n\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased21million shares of our common stock for $9.7billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $22.5billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased2.8million shares for $1.9billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\n\n\nDuring fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we paid $395million, $398million, and $399million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $20million and retained earnings by $12.0billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.\n\n\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n(Continued)\n\n\nNote 16 -Employee Retirement Plans\n\n\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $255million, $227million, and $168million, respectively.\n\n\nNote 17 -Segment Information\n\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.\n\n\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive artificial intelligence, or AI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud.\n\n\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications.\n\n\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between ourtwosegments.\n\n\nThe \"All Other\" category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, intellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.

We acquired the business of a Michigan company, also known as Ford Motor Company, which had been incorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and engineered by Henry Ford.  We are a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan.  With about 177,000 employees worldwide, the Company is committed to helping build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.  The Company's Ford+ plan for growth and value creation combines existing strengths, new capabilities, and always-on relationships with customers to enrich experiences for customers and deepen their loyalty.  Ford develops and delivers innovative, must-have Ford trucks, sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and cars, and Lincoln luxury vehicles, along with connected services.  The Company does that through three customer-centered business segments:  Ford Blue, engineering iconic gas-powered and hybrid vehicles; Ford Model e, inventing breakthrough electric vehicles (\"EVs\") along with embedded software that defines always-on digital experiences for all customers; and Ford Pro, helping commercial customers transform and expand their businesses with vehicles and services tailored to their needs.  Additionally, the Company provides financial services through Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (\"Ford Credit\").\n\n\nIn addition to the information about Ford and our subsidiaries contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (\"2023 Form 10-K Report\" or \"Report\"), extensive information about our Company can be found athttp://corporate.ford.com, including information about our management team, brands, products, services, and corporate governance principles.\n\n\nThe corporate governance information on our website includes our Corporate Governance Principles, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Personnel, Code of Ethics for the Board of Directors, Code of Corporate Conduct for all employees, and the Charters for each of the Committees of our Board of Directors.

As a result of this change, we analyze the results of our business through the following segments:  Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro (combined, replacing the previous Automotive segment); Ford Next (previously the Mobility segment); and Ford Credit.  Company adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") includes the financial results of these five reportable segments and Corporate Other, and net income comprises the financial results of the five reportable segments and Corporate Other, as well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.\n\n\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nFORD BLUE SEGMENT\n\n\nFord Blue primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln internal combustion engine (\"ICE\") and hybrid vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing Ford and Lincoln ICE and hybrid vehicles.  Additionally, this segment provides hardware engineering and manufacturing capabilities to Ford Model e and manufactures vehicles on behalf of Ford Pro and, in certain cases, Ford Model e.  Ford Blue also includes:\n\n\n\u2022All sales for markets not presently in scope for Ford Model e or Ford Pro (as further described below)\n\n\n\u2022In markets outside of the United States and Canada, sales to commercial, government, and rental customers of ICE and hybrid vehicles not considered core to Ford Pro\n\n\n\u2022Sales of electric vehicles (\"EVs\") by our unconsolidated affiliates in China\n\n\n\u2022All sales of vehicles manufactured and sold to other OEMs\n\n\nFORD MODEL E SEGMENT\n\n\nFord Model e primarily includes the sale of our electric vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing EV and digital vehicle technologies, as well as software development.  Additionally, Ford Model e provides software and connected vehicle technologies on behalf of the enterprise, and manufactures certain EVs, including for Ford Pro.  Ford Model e operates in North America, Europe, and China.  Ford Model e also includes EV and related sales not considered core to Ford Pro to commercial, government, and rental customers in Europe, China, and Mexico.\n\n\nFORD PRO SEGMENT\n\n\nFord Pro primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, accessories, and services for commercial, government, and rental customers.  Included in this segment are sales of all core Ford Pro vehicles, such as Super Duty and the Transit range of vans in North America and Europe and all sales of Ranger in Europe.  In the United States and Canada, Ford Pro also includes all vehicle sales to commercial, government, and rental customers.  This segment focuses on selling ICE, hybrid, and electric vehicles, and providing digital and physical services to optimize and maintain fleets, including telematics and EV charging solutions.  This segment reflects external sales of vehicles produced by Ford Blue and Ford Model e and the costs (including intersegment markup) associated with acquiring vehicles for sale and providing services.  Ford Pro operates in North America and Europe.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nOur vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln.  In 2023, we sold approximately 4,413,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world.  See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" (\"Item 7\") for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.\n\n\n2\n\n\nSubstantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively, \"dealerships\"), the substantial majority of which are independently owned.  At December 31, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows:\n\n\nBrand\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nFord\n\n\n8,596\n\n\n8,639\n\n\nFord-Lincoln (combined)\n\n\n607\n\n\n503\n\n\nLincoln\n\n\n408\n\n\n385\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n9,611\n\n\n9,527\n\n\nWe do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nIn addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments.  We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these products to retailers).  We also offer extended service contracts.\n\n\nThe worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little control.  Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle.  The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and utility vehicles, the availability and cost of financing, cost of fuel, and electric vehicle charging availability and cost).  As a result, the number of cars, trucks, and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year.  Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.\n\n\nOur wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand.  Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production.  Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, sustainability, and reputation.  Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions.  Our ability to satisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics and the services our vehicles offer, affects our sales and earnings significantly.\n\n\nAs with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:\n\n\n\u2022Wholesale unit volumes\n\n\n\u2022Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as:\n\n\n\u25e6Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)\n\n\n\u25e6Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles\n\n\n\u25e6Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions\n\n\n\u25e6Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment\n\n\n\u2022A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability\n\n\nAlthough supply disruptions have resulted in near-term upward pressure on new vehicle prices, our industry has historically had a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by excess capacity.  For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have offered price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels, and we saw some of these actions resume in 2023 with more expected in 2024 as industry production and inventories improve.  The decline in value of foreign currencies can also contribute significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.\n\n\nCompetitive Position.The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer.  Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.\n\n\n3\n\n\nSeasonality.We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers).  Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year).\n\n\nRaw Materials.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of, and development of technologies in, our vehicles.  These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.  We expect to have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs; however, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs.  See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of the risks associated with a shortage of components or raw materials, supplier disruptions, and inflationary pressures, the \"Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\" section of Item 7 for a discussion of supplier disruptions, as well as commodity and energy price changes, and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" (\"Item 7A\") for a discussion of commodity price risks.\n\n\nIntellectual Property.We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis.  We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our business.  We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally.  While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement.\n\n\nWarranty Coverage, Field Service Actions, and Customer Satisfaction Actions.We provide warranties on vehicles we sell.  Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.  Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period.  In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns) and for customer satisfaction actions.\n\n\nFor additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\n4\n\n\nWholesales\n\n\nWholesales consist primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships.  For the majority of such sales, we recognize revenue when we ship the vehicles to our dealerships from our manufacturing facilities.  See Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices.  Wholesales in certain key markets during the past three years were as follows:\n\n\nWholesales (a)\n\n\n(in thousands of units)\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n1,716\n\n\n2,012\n\n\n2,097\n\n\nChina (b)\n\n\n649\n\n\n495\n\n\n467\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n233\n\n\n258\n\n\n260\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n227\n\n\n263\n\n\n243\n\n\nGermany\n\n\n152\n\n\n182\n\n\n162\n\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\n\n\n72\n\n\n85\n\n\n124\n\n\nItaly (c)\n\n\n93\n\n\n107\n\n\n122\n\n\nFrance (c)\n\n\n77\n\n\n90\n\n\n104\n\n\nOther Markets\n\n\n723\n\n\n739\n\n\n834\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\n3,942\n\n\n4,231\n\n\n4,413\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Wholesale unit volumes include sales of medium and heavy trucks.  Wholesale unit volumes also include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, local brand units produced by our unconsolidated Chinese joint venture Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. (\"JMC\") that are sold to dealerships or others, and from the second quarter of 2021, Ford badged vehicles produced in Taiwan by Lio Ho Group.  Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes.  Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue.\n\n\n(b)China includes Taiwan.\n\n\n(c)Not previously presented.\n\n\nSales, Industry Volume, and Market Share\n\n\nSales, industry volume, and market share in certain key markets during the past three years were as follows:\n\n\nSales (a)\n\n\nIndustry Volume (b)\n\n\nMarket Share (c)\n\n\n(in millions of units)\n\n\n(in millions of units)\n\n\n(as a percentage)\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n15.4\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n13.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nChina (d)\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n23.9\n\n\n25.1\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.8\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n15.2\n\n\n13.7\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n12.1\n\n\n10.8\n\n\nGermany\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n5.1\n\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n10.5\n\n\n8.9\n\n\nItaly (e)\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n6.1\n\n\nFrance (e)\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Represents primarily sales by dealers, sales to the government, and leases to Ford management, and is based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy trucks.\n\n\n(b)Industry volume is an internal estimate based on publicly available data collected from various government, private, and public sources around the globe; includes medium and heavy trucks.\n\n\n(c)Market share represents reported retail sales of our brands as a percent of total industry volume in the relevant market or region.\n\n\n(d)China includes Taiwan; China market share includes Ford brand and JMC brand vehicles produced and sold by our unconsolidated affiliates.\n\n\n(e)Not previously presented.\n\n\n5\n\n\nU.S. Sales by Type\n\n\nThe following table shows U.S. sales volume and U.S. wholesales (consisting primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships) segregated by electric, hybrid, and internal combustion vehicles.

The predominant share of Ford Credit's business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers.  Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease (retail financing) and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our affiliates; and payments made under dealer financing programs.\n\n\nAs a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfolios \u2014\"consumer\" and \"non-consumer.\"  Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use.  Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.  Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers.  Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs.  Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies.  Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees.\n\n\nThe majority of Ford Credit's business is in the United States and Canada.  Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford Credit's largest operation.  Ford Credit's European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (\"FCE\").  Within Europe, Ford Credit's largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\n\nSee Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit's receivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies.  See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks.\n\n\nWe routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers' customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer's customer.  These programs increase Ford Credit's financing volume and share.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs.\n\n\nWe have a Third Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit's financial statement leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 12.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such financial statement leverage to have been 12.5:1.  No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement.  In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCE's net worth in excess of $500 million.  No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.\n\n\nFord Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit.  The reports are available through Ford Credit's website located atwww.ford.com/finance/investor-centerand can also be found on the SEC's website located atwww.sec.gov.\n\n\nThe foregoing information regarding Ford Credit's website and its content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Report nor filed with the SEC.\n\n\n7\n\n\nCORPORATE OTHER\n\n\nCorporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and other postretirement employee benefits (\"OPEB\") income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending.  Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.  These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company's interests.\n\n\nINTEREST ON DEBT\n\n\nInterest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.\n\n\nGOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS\n\n\nMany governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, air pollution emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment.  In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances.  The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:\n\n\nU.S. Vehicle Emissions Standards and Fuel Economy\n\n\nFederal and California Emissions Standards.Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time.  In addition to regulating emissions of certain pollutants for which EPA has adopted ambient health-based standards, EPA and CARB also regulate greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions from vehicles.  As of December 31, 2023, seventeen states (referenced as \"opt-in\" states) have adopted CARB's light-duty emissions standards, and nine opt-in states have adopted California's heavy-duty standards. The list of opt-in states changes over time, based on the legislative and regulatory actions by each individual state.  Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines to be equipped with on-board diagnostic (\"OBD\") systems that monitor emission-related systems and components.  Light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines or vehicles must be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant opt-in states.  Canada accepts EPA certification.  Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased product development costs, higher retail prices, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.\n\n\nFor light- and medium-duty passenger cars and light trucks, EPA promulgated a rule in 2021 establishing GHG standards applicable from model years 2023 through 2026.  This rule reversed a rollback of GHG standards that EPA had previously promulgated in 2020.  The 2021 rule is the subject of a pending legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.  In 2023, EPA proposed more stringent standards regulating GHG emissions and criteria pollutants\u2014with other updates to durability, warranty, and OBD requirements\u2014for light- and medium-duty vehicles that would phase in from model years 2027 through 2032.  These standards are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024.  The new regulations are expected to be substantially more stringent than current standards, and are intended to drive a significant increase in electric vehicle sales mix along with emissions reductions from internal combustion vehicles.  The EPA rules are therefore expected to impose increased challenges and costs for light-duty vehicle manufacturers, including Ford.\n\n\nIn 2019, EPA revoked California's authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards that apply through model year 2025, together with the authority of the opt-in states to implement California's standards.  During this time, Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis for model years 2021 through 2026 that were more stringent than the then-rolled back federal standards in lieu of the California regulatory program.  This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis.  EPA's 2021 rule established GHG standards that are more stringent than this California framework agreement.  Further, in 2022, EPA reversed the 2019 revocation of California's authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards.  That reversal is also the subject of a legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.\n\n\n8\n\n\nIn 2022, CARB adopted new light-duty emissions standards applicable to vehicles beginning in model year 2026 as part of its new Advanced Clean Cars II (\"ACC II\") regulations.  ACC II includes more stringent emissions standards and other new emissions requirements, with the stated goal of 100% electrification of new passenger cars and trucks by 2035.  EPA has yet to take final action on CARB's request for a waiver of federal preemption for the ACC II standards, which will be necessary before they can be enforced.  The expected court ruling in the legal challenge to EPA's reversal of the revocation of California's authority could also impact EPA's action on CARB's request for a waiver of preemption for ACC II.\n\n\nCARB has also adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 and later heavy-duty engines, as well as extended heavy-duty warranty requirements beginning with model year 2022.  EPA has granted waivers of preemption for some of CARB's heavy-duty standards, and is expected to grant or deny waivers for the remaining standards in 2024 (agency action which could be impacted by the outcome of the litigation over the waiver for CARB's light-duty standards).  EPA itself has adopted more stringent heavy-duty criteria emissions standards, beginning with the 2027 model year, and proposed more stringent heavy-duty GHG emissions standards, also beginning with the 2027 model year, which are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024.  These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD.  In Ford's case, the heavy-duty emissions standards\u2014as well as the fuel economy standards discussed below\u2014primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, as well as vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.  As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.\n\n\nThe new rules promulgated by EPA and CARB are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on Ford and other manufacturers of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines.  Stringent federal or state agency fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions could also force Ford to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and operations.  Such actions could include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; taking actions to increase sales of Ford's most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain internal combustion vehicles, such as high-performance cars, utility vehicles, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.  The ongoing litigation challenging EPA and CARB standards and potential future federal reversals and rollbacks create risks for Ford's planning and investing for compliance, or could also potentially relieve the burdens of misalignment of the standards with market conditions.\n\n\nCompliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.  Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers' warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards.\n\n\nCalifornia ZEV Requirements.The California vehicle emissions program includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (\"ZEVs\").  California's light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.  By model year 2025, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer's California light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs.  In ACC II, California has revised the ZEV regulation in a way that will continue to increase ZEV sales.  Beginning with model year 2026, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% light-duty ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.  The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage and new requirements for EV battery durability.  EPA must either decide that these revisions fall within the scope of prior waivers of federal preemption granted for CARB's ZEV amendments or waive preemption for these standards before the standards can be enforced.  Also, California has instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model year.  These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could yield significant costs and compliance challenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements.  As of December 31, 2023, sixteen states have adopted California's ZEV requirements.  Additionally, in 2023, California adopted new medium- and heavy-duty fleet purchase requirements that include a 100% ZEV manufacturer sales requirement starting in 2036.  Compliance with ZEV requirements depends on market conditions (including consumer preference for and the pricing of EVs) in each jurisdiction where the requirements apply (such as California and each opt-in state), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.\n\n\nFederal Fuel Economy Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles.Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (\"CAFE\") standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\").  Manufacturers are subject to civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.  The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer's fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.\n\n\n9\n\n\nBecause the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emissions correspond closely with fuel economy.  Historically, NHTSA and EPA have therefore coordinated with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.  Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the \"One National Program\" (\"ONP\") framework, and California agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of federal and state standards.  In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially aligned with EPA's GHG standards.  These standards are subject to a legal challenge, with a court decision expected in 2024.  In 2023, NHTSA proposed increasingly stringent fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks in model years 2027-2031 and heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans in model years 2030 through 2035.  NHTSA proposed these fuel economy standards separately from EPA's proposed GHG standards for the same model years, and it is not clear whether the NHTSA and EPA standards will be aligned, or whether they will be aligned with CARB's ACC II standards.  Different standards pose additional compliance burdens, including complexity and costs.\n\n\nGlobal Vehicle Emissions Standards and Fuel Economy\n\n\nEuropean Emissions Standards.EU and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in 2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or \"RDE\").  These on-road emission tests are in addition to the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017).  The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase.  In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation.  The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission's indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication \"EU Green Deal\" as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan, these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom.  In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (\"WVTA\") regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance.  Moreover, following the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which could increase vehicle complexity and duties.\n\n\nThere is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles.  The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities.  The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase.  In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO2taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the Netherlands in 2030.\n\n\nOther National Emissions Control Requirements.Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"UN-ECE\") mobile source emission regulations.  Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations.  For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions.  Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit.  The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard's emissions limits, which are currently in place nationwide in China, are approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutants.  Both China Stage VII light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles emission regulations are expected to be drafted between 2024 and 2025, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) tailpipe emissions.  Mexico and most countries in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.  Other countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australasia expect to introduce regulations based on EU Stage VI standards in the near term.  Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements and are anticipated to remain aligned with the new EPA rules that will be published in 2024 for 2027 model year and beyond.\n\n\n10\n\n\nElsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards.  Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted.  This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.\n\n\nGlobal Developments.Vehicle emissions regulators continue to focus on the use of \"defeat devices.\"  Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.  They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.\n\n\nRegulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers' emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers.  EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program.  CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles.  In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices.  Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis.  In addition, plaintiffs' attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.\n\n\nEuropean GHG Requirements.The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2emissions using sliding scales with different CO2targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.  A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2targets.  Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO2performance.  For \"multi-stage vehicles\" (e.g., Ford's Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.  The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new light-duty vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management to enable low CO2emissions for our fleet.  EU heavy-duty CO2regulations are being finalized and will also limit CO2fleet performance, with slightly different requirements.  The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules for light-duty vehicles, and the United Kingdom has adopted ZEV mandates as well as CO2fleet limits for non-ZEV vehicles starting in 2024.\n\n\nThe EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges.  As discussed above, the EU Commission has announced a \"Green Deal\" with more stringent requirements for CO2emissions (including stricter CO2fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions.  While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and an ambitious 2030 interim target (a 55% CO2reduction across all industries compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.\n\n\nFord also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance.\n\n\nThe United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2.  This world light-duty test procedure (\"WLTP\") is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2and fuel consumption figures with customer-reported figures.  The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2labeling, thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2tax scheme as well as CO2fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.  Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.\n\n\nSome European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord.  For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2emissions.  The EU CO2requirements are likely to trigger further measures.  In addition, delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO2emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced or for other reasons, can trigger compliance risks in all European markets.\n\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition to imposing strict emissions requirements, European regulations are increasingly including other sustainability requirements, such as reporting obligations and supply chain due diligence.  While these regulations are applicable in European jurisdictions, they often apply to global corporations and require adjustments in corporate processes, policies, and strategies, which may be costly.  For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requires companies to disclose how their business model and strategy align with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0Cin line with the Paris Agreement.  Companies that fail to comply with these requirements could face significant monetary penalties and suffer reputational harm.\n\n\nIn 2023, the EU adopted the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (\"CBAM\"), which will subject certain imported materials (such as iron, steel, and aluminum) to a carbon levy linked to the carbon price payable on domestic goods under the European Trading Scheme.  The CBAM could increase our costs of importing such materials and/or limit our ability to import lower cost materials from non-EU countries.\n\n\nOther National GHG and Fuel Economy Requirements.Regional governments across the globe are considering implementing, and in some cases introducing, emissions regulations that align with CAFE standards.  The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light-duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model years.  The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2026 model years, and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not automatically adopted by reference were published in December 2022.  The heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements.  Ford expects that the federal government in Canada will continue to align its standards with the new EPA standards for the 2027 model year and beyond.  On December 20, 2023, the Canadian federal government also published light-duty ZEV sales requirements through amendments to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations.  The amendments require annual sales percentages starting with 20% for the 2026 model year to 100% by the 2035 model year.  The federal government has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles beginning with the 2027 model year.  Both Quebec and British Columbia have regulations requiring that 100% of new vehicle sales be ZEVs by 2035, but finalized amendments in 2023 that increase their interim annual targets starting in 2025 and 2026.  Both provinces have also started developing heavy-duty ZEV mandates based on CARB's standards.  Compliance with ZEV requirements depends heavily on market conditions that promote consumer preference for EVs, such as technology readiness, purchase incentives, and affordability, as well as the availability and reliability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.  In addition to the ZEV mandates, Quebec is also developing a regulation to ban the sale of light-duty internal combustion engine vehicles as of 2035, which is intended to capture only small manufacturers not already obligated under the ZEV mandate.  Other provinces have signaled their interest in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are waiting to assess the provincial impact of the final federal ZEV regulations.\n\n\nChina's Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (\"NEV\") Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles.  The fuel consumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish targets, with year-over-year target reductions.  China set a target of 4.6L/100km for the 2025 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average and is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction to a target of 3.5L/100km in 2030, based on the WLTP.  The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV credits of at least  28% and 38% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volumes required in 2024 and 2025, respectively.  Future percentages are currently proposed as 45%, 50%, and 54% of the annual ICE plus NEV passenger vehicles production or import volumes for 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively.\n\n\nDemand for EVs continues to grow, at fluctuating rates.  As discussed below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under\"Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,\"in addition to the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our vehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements.  In the fourth quarter of 2023, for example, we entered into an agreement to purchase about $700 million of regulatory compliance credits for future use in the United States, the ultimate number of which is dependent on the seller's ability to deliver the credits.\n\n\n12\n\n\nVehicle Safety\n\n\nU.S. Requirements.The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the \"Safety Act\") regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways.  First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA.  Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance requirements and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs (\"NCAPs\"), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (\"IIHS\"), and the China Insurance Auto Safety Index) ratings and assessments continue to evolve, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally.  As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicle technologies and broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased.  Similarly, federal and state regulatory requirements are growing quickly as lawmakers and regulators adapt to advancements in automation, ranging from driver-assistance technologies such as automatic braking to fully autonomous vehicles.  Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it or NHTSA determines the vehicles contain a non-compliance or a defect resulting in an unreasonable risk to safety.  Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\n\nEuropean Requirements.The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\n\nThe European General Safety Regulation (\"GSR\") introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process.  The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024.  EU regulators are focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist.  Furthermore, mobile network providers in certain EU Member States have begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing vehicles.  The e-Call systems in existing vehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out.  It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.\n\n\nOther National Requirements.Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns.  Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; we are seeking new opportunities in bilateral negotiations that can potentially contribute to this goal.\n\n\nSafety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") countries may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice.  Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not maintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance.  In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety.  In 2021, Canada started preliminary consultations on several new proposed regulations, including Administrative Monetary Penalties (\"AMPs\") and Analysis of Technical Information for Vehicles and Equipment (\"ACTIVE\") regulations.  Final regulations for AMPs took effect in October 2023.  Draft regulations for ACTIVE are expected to be released in 2024 and will likely contain some reporting requirements that are unique to Canada.  In China, new standards regulating Intelligent and Connected Vehicles, vehicle cybersecurity, software updates, and Data Storage System for Automated Driving (\"DSSAD\"), which are more comprehensive than UN-ECE requirements, are expected to take effect in 2026, and in China, Malaysia, and South Korea, mandatory e-Call requirements are being drafted.  E-Call became mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles starting with the 2021 model year, and, following an update to its next generation e-Call regulations, will be required in Saudi Arabia beginning with the 2027 model year.\n\n\n13\n\n\nNew Car Assessment Programs.Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles.  NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest.  Achieving high NCAP ratings, which may vary by country or region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.  Similarly, environmental rating systems exist in various regions, e.g., Green NCAP in Europe.  In China, C-NCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of five-star ratings.  In Southeast Asia, an updated NCAP test and rating protocol is similarly forecast to be effective beginning in 2026, and is expected to put greater emphasis on assessment of driver assistance technologies.  These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing, evaluation, and mandatory safety features, and compliance with them (or any subsequent updates to them) may be costly.\n\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nPeople Strategy and Governance\n\n\nWe strive to create an employee experience that enables an inclusive environment of excellence, focus, and collaboration among team members, allowing us to deliver short- and long-term business success.  Ford maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of our Ford+ plan.  Key topic areas include Compensation & Retention; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"DEI\"); Organization Design; Talent Planning & Development; and Culture.\n\n\nOur Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters, including items discussed at the Executive People Forum.  The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss, and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including:  compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; DEI; and talent development programs.  The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies, the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible sourcing.  Collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are an important part of how we proactively manage our human capital and create an employee experience that allows employees and our organization to thrive.\n\n\nEmployee Health and Safety\n\n\nNothing is more important than the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees and we consistently strive to achieve world-class levels of safety through the application of sound policies and best practices.  We maintain a robust safety culture designed to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking.\n\n\nWe verify compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal safety standards.  To prevent recurrence of workplace injuries, regular updates are provided to Company management on key safety issues, including safety key performance indicators (\"KPI\"), significant incidents, and high potential near misses.  Our safety team also participates in multi-industry benchmarking groups, within and outside the automotive sector, to share safety best practices and collaborate on common health and safety concerns.\n\n\nOur Safety Record\n\n\nAny loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted.  Unfortunately, there was one employee fatality incident in 2023.  Robust corrective actions have been implemented to prevent recurrence and reduce risk to our employees and contractors working on site.  We continue to encourage accurate and detailed reporting of safety issues to reduce risk and improve workplace safety.\n\n\n14\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\n\nAt Ford, we believe that creating and sustaining a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion for all our employees is  foundational to both achieving our Ford+ plan and treating employees with dignity and respect.  Ford offers 10 global Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, and generation with chapters throughout the world.  Our ERGs are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products, services, and experiences.\n\n\nFord empowers leaders to develop DEI action plans specific to the unique needs and culture of each function and region.  From an enterprise perspective, we have taken several concrete steps to further these efforts, including embedding DEI into our corporate strategy and governance, highlighting DEI in the expected behaviors that support Ford's operating system, and forming an enterprise DEI Council composed of leaders to drive integration across employees, suppliers, dealers, and customers.  This holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on equity throughout the employee experience, monitoring the diversity within both internal and external talent pipelines, and DEI education.\n\n\nOur diversity statistics include the following as of December 31, 2023:  27.9% of our salaried employees worldwide identify as females; 25.5% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States identify as female; and 36.7% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States identify as a minority.\n\n\nTalent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment\n\n\nTalent attraction at Ford is evolving with the transformation of our business.   We are sourcing and attracting candidates from multiple industries and regions of the world.  We continue to recruit talent from traditional industries, such as manufacturing and consulting, and have been successful in attracting talent from non-traditional industries, specifically the technology industry.  This is important as we build our expertise in growth areas such as software, electrification, and integrated services.\n\n\nFrom a capability perspective, we leverage best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of excellence, focus, and collaboration.  The performance management process is reviewed regularly to ensure we set clear expectations, measure individual performance, and reward appropriately.  Our process includes a semi-annual review of each individual's performance to objectives and demonstration of expected behaviors of excellence, focus, and collaboration.\n\n\nFinally, the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to drive our transformation plays a vital role in our strategy, and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen their capabilities with dedicated traditional and non-traditional learning opportunities.  Our leadership strategy equips our leaders with the capabilities to deliver business results and grow the talent needed to meet our organizational needs.\n\n\nEmployee Wellbeing Initiatives\n\n\nOur global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees.  Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees, build capability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals.  Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs.\n\n\nWe use data-driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts.  We provide global wellbeing programs, such as Employee Assistance Programs and mindfulness sessions, among other things.  In addition, we provide employees with experiences, self-guided tools, and social connection opportunities, as well as access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing.  We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford+.\n\n\n15\n\n\nEmployee Sentiment Strategy\n\n\nWe gather feedback from our employees through a variety of channels throughout the year.  Our approach is designed to capture sentiment and make it actionable for managers, leadership, and for the teams designing the tools, processes, and policies that impact the employee experience.  We use a mix of annual and real-time surveys designed to understand employee sentiment in areas such as:  people leader effectiveness, job satisfaction, DEI, wellbeing, overall satisfaction, strategy and execution, and Ford Operating System behaviors.\n\n\nA critical element of measuring sentiment is ensuring the data gets to those who are best positioned to use it to drive improvements in the employee experience.  We design dashboards and tools for managers to view the results from their teams, help them to generate meaningful insights, and convert those insights into guided actions.  We share the results with senior executives to identify broader trends and themes and to inform larger strategic decisions across the Company.\n\n\nEmployment Data\n\n\nThe approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31 was as follows (in thousands):\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n84\n\n\n87\n\n\nRest of World\n\n\n84\n\n\n85\n\n\nCompany excluding Ford Credit\n\n\n168\n\n\n172\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\n173\n\n\n177\n\n\nSubstantially all of the hourly employees in our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  In the United States, approximately 99% of these unionized hourly employees are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\"UAW\" or \"United Auto Workers\").  At December 31, 2023, approximately 59,000 hourly employees in the United States were represented by the UAW.\n\n\n16We have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories:  Operational Risks; Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks; Financial Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks.\n\n\nOperational Risks\n\n\nFord is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford's production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford's production of vehicles.Our products contain components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers.  If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain or a supplier is unable to deliver a component to us in accordance with our specifications, because of a production issue, limited availability of materials, shipping problems, restrictions on transactions with certain countries or companies, or other reason, and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier, or we are unable to obtain a component on a timely basis, the shortage may disrupt our operations or increase our costs of production.\n\n\nFor the production of our electric vehicles, we are dependent on the supply of batteries and the raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese) used by our suppliers to produce those batteries.  As we increase our production of electric vehicles, we expect our need for such materials to increase significantly.  At the same time, other companies are increasing their production of electric vehicles, which will further increase the demand for such raw materials.  As a result, we may be unable to acquire raw materials needed for electric vehicle production in sufficient amounts that are responsibly sourced or at reasonable prices.  As described below under \"To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast\" as well as in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 below,  we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts that obligate us, subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from certain raw materials suppliers.  In the event the supplier under those agreements or any of our or our suppliers' raw material supply contracts is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of raw materials needed for our or our suppliers' production operations, e.g., if a mine does not produce at expected levels, or the raw materials do not otherwise satisfy our requirements, and we or our suppliers are unable to find an alternative resource with sufficient quantities, at reasonable prices, responsibly sourced (e.g., in compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and similar regulations and standards), and in a timely manner, it could impact our ability to produce electric vehicles.\n\n\nA shortage of, or our inability to acquire or find adequate suppliers of, key components or raw materials as a result of disruptions in the supply chain, capacity constraints, limited availability, competition for those items within the automotive industry and other sectors, or otherwise can cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, as a result of lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates or otherwise, suppliers of such raw materials or components may become distressed.\n\n\nTo facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast.We have announced plans to significantly increase our electric vehicle production volumes; however, our ability to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles is dependent upon the availability of raw materials and other components necessary for the production of batteries, e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among others.  As described above under \"Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford's production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford's production of vehicles,\" to facilitate our access to such raw materials, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts.  Such agreements obligate us, subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from raw material suppliers over an agreed upon period of time pursuant to an agreed upon purchase price mechanism that is typically based upon the market price of the material at the time of delivery.\n\n\n17\n\n\nUnlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials, batteries, or their components are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers.  In the event we do not purchase the materials or components pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we may be obligated to reimburse the supplier for costs it incurs.  We have incurred and we may continue to incur such charges.  This may be the case even if the supplier finds another purchaser, as we may be responsible for the costs of finding the new purchaser as well as any lost revenue attributable to the replacement purchaser paying a lower price than required under the pricing mechanism in our agreement.\n\n\nAs a result of the competition for and limited availability of the raw materials needed for our electric vehicle business, the costs of such materials are difficult to accurately forecast as they may fluctuate during the term of the offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts based on market conditions.  Accordingly, we may be subject to increases in the prices we pay for those raw materials, and our ability to recoup such costs through increased pricing to our customers may be limited.  As a result, our margins, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation may be adversely impacted by commitments we make pursuant to offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts.\n\n\nFord's long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+.We previously announced our plan for growth and value creation \u2013 Ford+.  Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus \"Always-On\" customer relationships and user experiences.  Our Ford+ plan is designed to leverage our foundational strengths to build new capabilities \u2013 enriching customer experiences and deepening loyalty.  As we undertake this transformation of our business, we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model, and balance competing priorities, or we will not be successful.  To facilitate this transformation, we are making substantial investments, recruiting new talent, and optimizing our business model, management system, and organization.  Accordingly, maintaining discipline in our capital allocation continues to be important, as a strong core business and a balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford+ plan.  If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles, services, technology, and other calls on capital, make sufficient progress to become competitive on cost and quality, or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Furthermore, if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism, which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management's attention and resources.\n\n\nFord's vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business.Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.  We may also be obligated to remedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective components provided to us by our suppliers, arising from their quality issues or otherwise.  NHTSA's enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers' safety processes, a trend that could continue.  Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied.  The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production.  For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States.  Of these, approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles.  In addition, NHTSA is considering action related to 52 million vehicles containing inflators from ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive in the United States.  Ford has 2.5 million vehicles within this population.  Should NHTSA determine that these inflators contain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs.  Further, to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition.  We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.  In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.  For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs, including our process for establishing our reserves, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component complexity, the adoption of new technologies, the time it takes to improve the quality of our products and services (or if such efforts are unsuccessful), or otherwise (including as a result of higher repair costs driven by inflation or other economic factors), such costs could continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and\n\n\n18\n\n\nincreased warranty costs have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our reputation or the public perception and market acceptance of our products and services as discussed below under \"Ford's new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.\"  In an effort to improve quality, we have slowed down and may continue to slow down launches, which may result in lost sales, revenue, and profits and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, as a result of vehicles on hold for quality control, our inventory levels may be higher.\n\n\nFord may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies.We have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies.  These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity, may require a significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process.  As a result, we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed.  For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party.  Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems.  In order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less developed markets, adopt Ford's sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation.  In addition, the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations.  For example, our efforts to evaluate and implement alternative distribution models and channels for our products and services from those we have traditionally used may be challenged or may not succeed or be as successful as our historical arrangements.  External factors may also impact the success of our initiatives.  For example, our business and strategy are susceptible to tensions in U.S.-China relations and the rapid development of the Chinese electric vehicle industry, with domestic Chinese producers exporting to some key markets in which we operate.  In addition, as we transition to producing a higher percentage of electric vehicles, if industrywide adoption rates continue to be lower than anticipated, we may take actions to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption, such as not fully utilizing or reducing the capacity of our existing or future plants, reducing production hours or shifts, and we may become subject to claims by suppliers as a result.  Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy.  Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market.  Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFord may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation.We continually review and evaluate our business to find opportunities to make our operations more efficient and reduce costs.  In doing so, we have taken and may in the future take restructuring actions, such as strategic divestitures or ceasing of operations in a market, particularly for those businesses where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible in light of the capital allocation requirements or for other reasons.  Our plans for implementing such actions may be accelerated by shifting industry dynamics and new entrants to our industries with which we must compete.  These actions may include employee separations, a reduced footprint (e.g., plant closures or smaller operations at existing plants or plants that are not yet on-line), or operating our plants at less than full capacity (e.g., reducing shifts).  Such restructuring actions have caused us and may in the future cause us to incur significant costs; record impairments or other charges; subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, other counterparties, or governmental authorities (including a reduction or clawback of incentives); disrupt our operations; distract management from current operations; or harm our reputation.  Further, we may not realize the expected benefits of such restructuring actions (e.g., anticipated cost savings), such benefits may be delayed, or market dynamics or other factors may have evolved such that we cannot obtain the original intended results of an action.\n\n\n19\n\n\nOperational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.We rely on information technology networks and information systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business, our vehicles, and the services we offer.  Despite devoting significant resources to our cybersecurity program, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and compromises of: (i) operational information systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cybersecurity incident, security breach, or other reason (e.g., a natural disaster, fire, acts of terrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system).  Such incidents could materially disrupt operational information systems; result in loss or unwilling publication of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our vehicles.  This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity.  Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cybersecurity incidents and such threats are continuing and evolving, which may cause cybersecurity incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time.  Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a cybersecurity incident may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third-parties who have access to our networks and systems.  We employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures we believe are designed todetect, reduce, and mitigate the risk of cybersecurity incidents, and have requirements for our suppliers to do the same; however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities or might not accurately assess the risks of incidents, and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential production disruption or the loss or disclosure of sensitive information.  Moreover, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cybersecurity incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact our production, internal operations, business strategy, results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.\n\n\nFord's production, as well as Ford's suppliers' production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors.A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford's facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons, including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees, disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions (e.g., plant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of components or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including climate-related physical risk); social unrest; cybersecurity incidents; or for other reasons.  A suspension or substantial curtailment of our manufacturing operations could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as was the case in 2020, when, consistent with actions taken by governmental authorities, we idled our plants in regions around the world.  The duration of a suspension of manufacturing operations and a return to our full production schedule will vary.  Our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are suspended, but we continue to incur operating and non-operating expenses, resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow.  Accordingly, any significant future disruption to our production schedule, regionally or globally, whether as a result of our own or a supplier's suspension of operations, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.  Moreover, our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations triggered by a shutdown of operations.\n\n\nThe limited availability of components, labor shortages, public health emergencies, and supplier operating issues has led to intermittent interruptions in our supply chain and an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities.  This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers' operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.  As a result of this disrupted production schedule, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base for reimbursement of costs beyond our original agreed terms.  Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, we have made payments to our suppliers, and this trend may continue.\n\n\n20\n\n\nGiven the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme temperatures.  In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike, international conflict, or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production operations and customers' ability to receive our vehicles.\n\n\nMany components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore, cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).  Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations.  In addition, when we undertake a model changeover, significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier's facility.  Moreover, as vehicles, components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles.  Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited.  Accordingly, a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under \"Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.\"\n\n\nFailure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford's business.A growing part of our business involves connectivity, digital and physical services, and integrated software services, and we are devoting significant resources to develop this business.  If we fail to generate sufficient demand for our integrated software and digital services or if customers do not opt to activate the modems in our vehicles, which would hinder our ability to offer and sell such services, we may not grow revenue in line with the costs we are investing or achieve profitability on our increasingly digitally-connected products.  For additional discussion on the market acceptance of our services, see below under \"Ford's new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.\"\n\n\nWe contract with third parties to offer digital content to customers and license technologies for use in our software and digital services.  This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into our own services; however, continuation of these third-party licensing and other arrangements, or their renewal on commercially reasonable terms, is not guaranteed or may be unavailable.  Moreover, while we seek to grow our share of this business, third parties may be less inclined to continue developing or licensing software for Ford's products or permit the Company to distribute their content, or such providers may offer competing products and services to the detriment of our business.  If we are unable to offer integrated software applications and digital services on competitive terms, it may reduce customer demand or increase our costs to provide such applications and services, which we may be unable to pass on to customers.  Alternatively, we may have to develop or license new content or technology to provide digital services, and there can be no assurance we would be able to develop or license such content or technology at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.\n\n\nSophisticated software integration may have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or other software products and services.  In addition, the services we offer can have quality issues and may, from time to time, experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors.  As a result, these services may not always perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.  There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all issues and defects in the hardware, software, and services we offer, or successfully deliver over-the-air (\"OTA\") updates.  Failure to do so on a timely basis could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our products and services.  For additional discussion on the risks associated with defects and quality issues, see above under \"Ford's vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business.\"\n\n\n21\n\n\nThe actions of end users are generally beyond our control and some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities that involve our digital services.  These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service.  While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our digital services and related information systems, malicious entities have and will continue to attempt to gain unauthorized access to them.  If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective or timely, it may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.  For further information, see above under \"Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.\"\n\n\nFord's ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints.The vast majority of the hourly employees in our manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain conditions.  With the ratification of our new contracts with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\"UAW\") in the United States and Unifor in Canada in 2023, we expect to have a significant increase in labor costs through the life of the contracts, and if we are unable to offset those costs, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  Further, these agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.  Some of our competitors do not have such collective bargaining agreements and are not subject to the same constraints.  A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities or increase the cost of doing so.\n\n\nFord's ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness.Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, develop, grow, and reward talented and diverse employees with domain expertise in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), integrated services, supply chain, marketing, and finance, among other areas.  While we have been successful in attracting talent in recent years, as with any company, the ability to continue to attract talent is important, particularly in growth areas vital to our success such as software, electrification, and integrated services.  Competition for such talent is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for companies.  In addition to attracting talent, we must also retain the talent needed to deliver our business objectives.  While compensation considerations remain important, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.  If we are not perceived as an employer of choice, we may be unable to recruit the best talent.  Further, if we lose existing employees with needed skills or we are unable to develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies and our focus on operational efficiency and quality, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nMacroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks\n\n\nFord's new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced.Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services in the market.  It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle.  Because customers' preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs.  Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.  For example, if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n22\n\n\nWith increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.  Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on many factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network), and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric vehicles, autonomous technologies, digital and physical services, and software services.  The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes.  Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market.  For example, Chinese electric vehicle producers are exporting their products to some key markets in which we operate.  This level of competition necessitates that we invest in and integrate emerging technologies into our business and increases the importance of our ability to anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with demand, with the quality they expect, and at costs low enough to be profitable.  Moreover, if we do not meet customer expectations for quickly and effectively addressing and remedying issues that may develop with or that improve our products and services, e.g., successfully delivering OTA updates, it would have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n\nWe have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services.  Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit.  If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, we are unable to or are delayed in developing or embracing new technologies or processes, or if consumers prefer our competitors' vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, as discussed below under \"Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,\" lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.\n\n\nFord is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply chain.  We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years.  Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes; however, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved.  To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on the investment.  For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO2emissions in line with our targets or in compliance with applicable regulations.  Further, our customers, investors, and other stakeholders evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to purchase the products and services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies.  Other parties may object to the positions we have taken and may, in the future, take on environmental, social, or other issues, or in the event we change our position on such issues, which may result in a loss of customers, a boycott of our products or services, or other actions that may impact not only our brand and reputation but also our results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our Common Stock.\n\n\nMoreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated.  In addition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any manufacturer's autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and autonomous vehicle technologies and erode customer trust.\n\n\n23\n\n\nFord's results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States.A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result.  In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.\n\n\nWith a global footprint and supply chain, Ford's results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events.Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy, the challenges of a pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical crises, or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world.  Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general.  Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and could lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for customers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive.  In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S. automakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations, China's unique regulatory landscape, the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, and the rapid development of the Chinese electric vehicle industry, with Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers exporting their products to some key markets in which we operate.\n\n\nWith operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments and our global supply chain and utilization of transportation routes and logistics providers around the world, we are exposed to heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical, or other events.  This could include governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities (such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, heightened tensions in the Red Sea, and potential tensions in the South China Sea), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, the U.S. government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.\n\n\nIndustry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event.Because we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations.  Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions, consumer behavior, and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and ridesharing services.  If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.  For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.\n\n\nFord may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles.The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand.  Historically, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives.  As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations.  This risk includes cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices.  Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n24\n\n\nAlthough we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption.  As a result of the lower-than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we have accrued and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters.  Battery costs remain high, which is detrimental to electric vehicles reaching pricing parity with ICE vehicles and further exacerbates the pricing pressures on electric vehicles.  Furthermore, as we invest in battery production, including the construction of battery plants, if we are unable to operate those plants at their expected capacity because electric vehicle adoption rates remain lower-than-anticipated or otherwise, we may be unable to recoup the investments we have made.\n\n\nAs electric vehicle adoption rates increase, the risk of excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities, may be exacerbated.  This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nInflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit's investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results.We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.  We monitor and attempt to manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.  Changes in commodity and energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under \"With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford's results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events,\" or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility.  As a result, significant changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates as well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks.  These market forces have caused us to incur higher material costs, which may continue, and our warranty costs have increased, in part, due to inflationary cost pressures at our dealers.  Moreover, due to inflationary pressure, some of our suppliers have submitted claims to us for reimbursement of costs beyond our original agreed terms.  Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, we have made payments to our suppliers, and this trend may continue.  Further, interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.  Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.  At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact Ford Credit's ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.  In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.\n\n\nFinancial Risks\n\n\nFord and Ford Credit's access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.Ford and Ford Credit's ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness.  Further, Ford Credit's ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit's ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings for those transactions and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.  Over time, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.  In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.  A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.\n\n\nTo the extent interest rates remain relatively high, they may have an adverse effect on borrowing costs for Ford Credit, making it more expensive to fund our operations or leading to higher rates charged to our customers if these costs are passed on.\n\n\n25\n\n\nThe impact of government incentives on Ford's business could be significant, and Ford's receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback.We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production.  These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits.  The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.  A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our operations, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFor example, until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.  As a result, the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent.  The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.\n\n\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and other \"clean\" vehicles.  The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them.  These incentives change over time and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress.  The IRA's incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford.  The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs, and this credit is expected to improve the financial performance of domestic battery manufacturers, including the new operations at our upcoming facility in Michigan and BlueOval SK's facilities in Kentucky and Tennessee.  Further, the degree of success of some of our investment strategies depends upon IRA tax credit eligibility and for those credits to continue to remain available through the currently contemplated expiration.\n\n\nThe IRA also authorizes tax credits for purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles.  Ford expects that most commercial customers that purchase an EV or PHEV will be eligible for the commercial clean vehicle credit, although it is unclear at this time how many commercial vehicle purchasers will have the underlying federal tax liability that is necessary to actually monetize this credit.  When paired with the IRA's tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit will influence commercial fleets, governmental fleets, and other vehicle purchasers in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.\n\n\nTo claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price (\"MSRP\"); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains \"battery components\" that were \"manufactured or assembled\" by a \"foreign entity of concern\" will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains battery materials that were \"extracted, processed, or recycled\" by a \"foreign entity of concern\" will be ineligible.  A \"Critical Minerals Credit\" is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are \"extracted or produced\" in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is \"recycled\" in North America.  A \"Battery Components Credit\" is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of \"value\" of its battery \"components\" that are \"manufactured or assembled\" in North America.\n\n\nAlthough we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA, and the terms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S. government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof.  Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their vehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.\n\n\n26\n\n\nFord Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer's or dealer's failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit's business.  The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.  Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit's return on the lease transaction.  Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles, or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes.  Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values.  If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit's expectations.  Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit's results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit's projections.  See \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Item 7 for additional discussion.\n\n\nEconomic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed.The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.  We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).  We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred.  To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial.  For additional information regarding our assumptions, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\nPension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford's liquidity and financial condition.We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees.  We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.  In addition, we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).  See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.  These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity.  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\n\n\n27\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\n\nFord and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise.We spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations.  In addition, as discussed below under \"Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations\" and \"Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,\" regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status.  Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines, penalties, orders, or other resolutions that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of our business.  Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk.  In certain circumstances, courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law.  Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other resources.  Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we have in the past experienced and could in the future experience significant adverse results, including compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement of profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general, particularly with larger jury verdicts becoming more prevalent.  In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation, litigation, or investigation, even if there is no merit to the matter, may cause significant reputational harm or create a negative public perception of our products and services, which could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.\n\n\nFord may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations.The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within national boundaries.  Regulators have enacted and are proposing standards to address concerns regarding the environment (including concerns about global climate change and air quality), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice.  These regulations vary, but generally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including GHG emissions, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, and there are associated increased reporting requirements.  Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable.  As our suppliers make similar investments, any higher costs may be passed on to us.  In the United States, legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are continuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification.  Recently, different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last.  Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts.  In parallel, California continues to enact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for ZEVs (standards that some other states are adopting), and those actions are also the subject of legal challenges.  Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly.  In addition, many governments regulate local product content or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.\n\n\nWe regularly refine our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our internal combustion vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as hybrid and electrified vehicles, that generate lower GHG emissions.  Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets.  However, there are limits to our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over given time frames and many factors that could delay or impede our plans.  Those factors primarily relate to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies; consumer acceptance of new technologies and their costs; changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail above under \"Ford's new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced\"); the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles; the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric vehicles; the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make affordable batteries and other elements of electric vehicles; and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.  If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions or the consumer attributes\n\n\n28\n\n\nof our vehicles do not lead consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in sufficient numbers, it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards.  Moreover, the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our vehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans, or, in some cases, purchase credits, which we have done, in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cause reputational harm.\n\n\nIncreased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent enforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data, and delays in regulatory approvals.  The cost to comply with government regulations concerning new vehicle standards and in-use vehicle requirements, including field service actions, is substantial.  Additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix, as well as any non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.  Any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales.  Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise tode factochanges in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers.  For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business, see the \"Governmental Standards\" discussion in \"Item 1. Business\" above.\n\n\nWe and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle and driver assist technologies, and the U.S. and foreign governments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles and related technologies.  Manufacturers are facing increased scrutiny from regulators at the state and federal level on system misuse by customers, feature capabilities, and whether advertising for this technology contains false or misleading information.  Some states are developing their own regulations that impact the testing and design of autonomous vehicles.  This patchwork approach without federal guidance may subject Ford to additional compliance costs.  In addition, the demand for these services by consumers is fluctuating as the technology is rolled out in various stages and with mixed industry results.\n\n\nFord and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers' heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information.We are subject to laws, rules, guidelines from privacy and other regulators, and regulations in the United States and other countries (such as the European Union's and the U.K.'s General Data Protection Regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act) relating to the collection, use, cross-border data transfer, and security of personal information of consumers, employees, or others, including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data security incident.  Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information, are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country.  Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices.  Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise, misuse of consumer information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection, privacy, or artificial intelligence requirements.  The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify these risks.  Further, any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, cause us to expend significant resources, and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business and/or consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data.\n\n\nFord Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business.  In the United States, for example, Ford Credit's operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Consumer Leasing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\n\n29\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit's automotive financing business.  Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business.  The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit, for compliance with consumer financial protection laws.\n\n\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions, including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise practices, remunerate customers, or pay fines.  An enforcement action against Ford Credit could harm Ford Credit's reputation or lead to further litigation.None.\n\n\n30While no organization can eliminate cybersecurity risk entirely, we devote significant resources to our security program that we believe is reasonably designed to mitigate our cybersecurity and information technology risk.  Our efforts focus on protecting and enhancing the security of our information systems, software, networks, and other assets.  These efforts are designed to protect against, and mitigate the effects of, among other things, cybersecurity incidents where unauthorized parties attempt to access confidential, sensitive, or personal information; potentially hold such information for ransom; destroy data; disrupt or degrade service or our operations; sabotage systems; or otherwise cause harm to the Company, our customers, suppliers, or dealers, or other key stakeholders.  We employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures we believe are designed to reduce and mitigate these risks, and have requirements for our suppliers to do the same.  Despite having thorough due diligence, onboarding, and cybersecurity assessment processes in place for our suppliers, the responsibility ultimately rests with our suppliers to establish and uphold their respective cybersecurity programs.  Our ability to monitor the cybersecurity practices of our suppliers is limited and there can be no assurance that we can prevent or mitigate the risk of any compromise or failure in the information systems, software, networks, and other assets owned or controlled by our suppliers.  When we become aware that a supplier's cybersecurity has been compromised, we attempt to mitigate the risk to the Company, including, if appropriate and feasible, by terminating the supplier's connection to our information systems.  Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate any such risk, there can be no assurance that the compromise or failure of supplier information systems, technology assets, or cybersecurity programs would not have an adverse effect on the security of the Company's information systems.\n\n\nIn an effort to effectively prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats, we employ a multi-layered cybersecurity risk management program supervised by our Chief Information Security Officer, whose team is responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, architecture, and processes.  This responsibility includes identifying, considering, and assessing potentially material cybersecurity incidents on an ongoing basis, establishing processes designed to prevent and monitor potential cybersecurity risks, implementing mitigation and remedial measures, and maintaining our cybersecurity program.  To do so, our program leverages both internal and external techniques and expertise.  Internally, among other things, we perform penetration tests, internal tests/code reviews, and simulations using cybersecurity professionals (often referred to as \"white hat hackers\" or a \"Red Team\"), to assess vulnerabilities in our information systems and evaluate our cyber defense capabilities.  We also perform phishing and social engineering simulations with, and provide cybersecurity training for, personnel with Company email and access to Company assets.  On a monthly basis, we disseminate security awareness newsletters to employees to highlight emerging or urgent cybersecurity threats and best practices.  Externally, we monitor notifications from the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (\"CERT\") and various Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (each an \"ISAC\"); review customer, media, and third-party cybersecurity reports; and offer bounties to responsible third-parties who notify us of vulnerabilities they are able to detect in our cyber defenses (commonly referred to as a \"Bug Bounty\").  Our capabilities, processes, and other security measures also include, without limitation:\n\n\n\u2022Security Information and Event Management (\"SIEM\") software, which provides a threat detection, compliance, and security incident management system;\n\n\n\u2022Endpoint Detection and Response (\"EDR\") software, which monitors for malicious activities on external-facing endpoints (e.g., Windows workstations, servers, MAC clients, and Linux endpoints);\n\n\n\u2022Cloud monitoring, running on primary public and private cloud environments; and\n\n\n\u2022Disaster recovery and incident response plans, including a ransomware response plan.\n\n\nWe invest in enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities and strengthening our partnerships with appropriate business partners, service partners, and government and law enforcement agencies to understand the range of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses, and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats.  Additionally, we are a member of the Financial Services and Information Technology ISACs and both a founding member and board member of the Automotive ISAC.  Our membership with these industry cybersecurity groups assists in our efforts to protect the Company against both enterprise and in-vehicle security risks.\n\n\nThe Company's global cybersecurity incident response is overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer.  Our Chief Information Security Officer has served in that role for over 6 years and has over a decade of engineering and operations expertise with cybersecurity technologies and services.  Our Chief Information Security Officer reports to our Chief Enterprise Technology Officer who has spent over two decades leading digital and technology organizations at both enterprise software companies andFortune 50enterprises.  Our Chief Enterprise Technology Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\n31\n\n\nWhen a cybersecurity threat or incident is identified, our policy is to review and triage the threat or incident, and to then manage it to conclusion in accordance with our cybersecurity incident response processes.  When a cybersecurity incident is determined to be significant, it is addressed by management committees using processes that leverage subject-matter expertise from across the Company.  Further, we may engage third-party advisors, from time to time, as part of our incident management processes.  All cybersecurity incidents that are identified as reasonably having the potential to be highly significant to the Company are brought to the attention of both the Chief Enterprise Technology Officer and General Counsel by the Chief Information Security Officer as part of our cybersecurity incident response processes.\n\n\nCybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program.  As part of its enterprise risk management efforts, the Board meets with senior management, including the executive leadership team, to assess and respond to critical business risks.  Critical enterprise risks are assessed by senior management annually and discussed with the Board.  Once identified, each of the risks we view as most significant is assigned an executive risk owner who is responsible to oversee risk assessment, develop and implement mitigation plans, and provide regular updates to the Board (and/or Board committee assigned to the risk).  Cybersecurity threats have been and continue to be identified as one of the Company's top risks, with our Chief Enterprise Technology Officer and Chief Information Security Officer assigned as the executive risk owners.  The Board has delegated primary responsibility for the oversight of cybersecurity and information technology risks, and the Company's preparedness for these risks, to the Audit Committee.\n\n\nAs part of its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee receives regular updates on our cybersecurity practices as well as cybersecurity and information technology risks from our Chief Information Security Officer.  These regular updates include topics related to cybersecurity practices, cyber risks, and risk management processes, such as updates to our cybersecurity programs and mitigation strategies, and other cybersecurity developments.  In addition to these regular updates, as part of our incident response processes, the Chief Enterprise Technology Officer, in collaboration with the Chief Information Security Officer and General Counsel, provides updates on certain cybersecurity incidents to the Audit Committee and, in some cases, the Board.  The Audit Committee reviews and provides input into and oversight of our cybersecurity processes, and in the event Ford determines it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, the Audit Committee is notified about the incident in advance of filing a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\n\nIn 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.  However, despite the capabilities, processes, and other security measures we employ that we believe are designed to detect, reduce, and mitigate the risk of cybersecurity incidents, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities or might not accurately assess the risks of incidents, and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks.  Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have been the target of cybersecurity incidents and such threats are continuing and evolving, which may cause cybersecurity incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time.  Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures, could also be impacted by, or a cybersecurity incident may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems.  A cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cybersecurity incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact our business strategy, results of operations, financial condition, or our reputation.  For additional information, see \"Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers\" on page 20.\n\n\n32Our principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities, distribution centers, warehouses, sales or administrative offices, and testing, prototype, and operations space.\n\n\nWe own substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities.  Our facilities are situated in various sections of the country and include assembly plants, engine plants, casting plants, metal stamping plants, transmission plants, and other component plants.  Most of our distribution centers are leased (we own approximately 32% of the total square footage and lease the balance).  The majority of the warehouses that we operate are leased, although many of our manufacturing and assembly facilities contain some warehousing space.  Substantially all of our sales offices are leased space.  Approximately 85% of the total square footage of our testing, prototype, and operations space is owned by us.\n\n\nIn addition, we maintain and operate manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, parts distribution centers, and engineering centers outside of the United States.  We own substantially all of our non-U.S. manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, and engineering centers.  The majority of our parts distribution centers outside of the United States are either leased or provided by vendors under service contracts.\n\n\nWe and the entities that we consolidated as of December 31, 2023 use over 300 operations facilities globally, including testing and prototype, across 24 countries, and 41 manufacturing and assembly plants, which includes plants that are operated by us or our consolidated joint venture that support our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments.\n\n\nWe have one significant consolidated joint venture, which is in our Ford Blue segment:\n\n\n\u2022Ford Vietnam Limited\u2014 a joint venture between Ford (75% partner) and Diesel Song Cong One Member Limited Liability Company (a subsidiary of the Vietnam Engine and Agricultural Machinery Corporation, which in turn is majority owned (87.43%) by the State of Vietnam represented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade) (25% partner).  Ford Vietnam Limited assembles and distributes a variety of Ford passenger and commercial vehicle models.  The joint venture operates one plant in Vietnam.\n\n\nIn addition to the plants that we operate directly or that are operated by our consolidated joint venture, additional plants that support our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments are operated by unconsolidated joint ventures of which we are a partner.  The most significant of those unconsolidated joint ventures are as follows:\n\n\n\u2022AutoAlliance (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (\"AAT\")\u2014 a 50/50 joint venture between Ford and Mazda that owns and operates a manufacturing plant in Rayong, Thailand.  AAT produces Ford and Mazda products for domestic and export sales.\n\n\n\u2022BlueOval SK, LLC\u2014  a 50/50 joint venture among Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On) that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates.\n\n\n\u2022Changan Ford Automobile Corporation, Ltd. (\"CAF\")\u2014 a 50/50 joint venture between Ford and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., Ltd. (\"Changan\").  CAF operates four assembly plants, an engine plant, and a transmission plant in China where it produces and distributes a variety of Ford passenger vehicle models.\n\n\n\u2022Ford Otomotiv Sanayi Anonim Sirketi (\"Ford Otosan\")\u2014 a joint venture in T\u00fcrkiye among Ford (41% partner), the Koc Group of T\u00fcrkiye (41% partner), and public investors (18%) that is the sole supplier to us of the Transit, Transit Custom, and Transit Courier commercial vehicles and the Puma for Europe and the sole distributor of Ford vehicles in T\u00fcrkiye.  Ford Otosan also manufactures Ford heavy trucks for markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  The joint venture owns three plants, a parts distribution depot, and a research and development center in T\u00fcrkiye, and a combined vehicle and engine plant in Romania.\n\n\n\u2022JMC\u2014 a publicly-traded company in China with Ford (32% shareholder) and Nanchang Jiangling Investment Co., Ltd. (41% shareholder) as its controlling shareholders.  Nanchang Jiangling Investment Co., Ltd. is a 50/50 joint venture between Changan and Jiangling Motors Company Group.  The public investors in JMC own 27% of its total outstanding shares.  JMC assembles Ford Transit, a series of Ford SUVs, Ford engines, and non-Ford vehicles and engines for distribution in China and in other export markets.  JMC operates two assembly plants and one engine plant in Nanchang.\n\n\n33\n\n\nThe facilities described above are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for the manufacture and assembly of our and our joint ventures' products.\n\n\nThe furniture, equipment, and other physical property owned by our Ford Credit operations are not material in relation to the operations' total assets.The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.  See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies.  Following is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:\n\n\nPRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS\n\n\nWe are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging damages from injuries resulting from (or aggravated by) alleged defects in our vehicles.  In many actions, no monetary amount of damages is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum.  Our experience with litigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts, on average, bear little relation to the actual amount of damages, if any, that we will pay in resolving such matters.\n\n\nIn addition to pending actions, we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to us.  We also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation.  Individual product liability matters that have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described herein.  Currently there are no such matters to report.\n\n\nBelow is a product liability matter currently pending against Ford:\n\n\nHill v. Ford.Plaintiffs in this product liability action pending in Georgia state court allege that the roof of a 2002 Ford F-250 involved in a rollover accident was defectively designed.  During the first trial in 2018, the judge declared a mistrial, ruled that Ford's attorneys had violated pre-trial rulings while presenting evidence, and sanctioned Ford by prohibiting Ford from introducing any evidence at the second trial to show that the roof design of the F-250 was not defective.  During the second trial in August 2022, a jury found that Pep Boys (the party that sold the tires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident) was responsible for 30% of the damages, and Ford, as a direct result of the sanctions order prohibiting Ford from presenting its defense, was responsible for 70% of the damages, resulting in $16.8 million in damages being apportioned to Ford.  The jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of $1.7 billion.  We filed post-trial motions seeking a new trial, and on September 14, 2023, the trial court denied our post-trial motions.  On October 13, 2023, Ford filed a notice of appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals.  We believe the law supports our position that Ford is entitled to a new trial with the right to present evidence in its defense.\n\n\nASBESTOS MATTERS\n\n\nAsbestos was used in some brakes, clutches, and other automotive components from the early 1900s.  Along with other vehicle manufacturers, we have been the target of asbestos litigation and, as a result, are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos.  Plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either from component parts found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities, or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet.  We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims.\n\n\nMost of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles.  We are prepared to defend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles.  The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage awards.  The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages; in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum, and the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants.  Some of these cases may also involve multiple plaintiffs, and we may be unable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us (as opposed to other defendants).  Annual payout and defense costs may become significant in the future.  Our accrual for asbestos matters includes probable losses for both asserted and unasserted claims.\n\n\n34\n\n\nCONSUMER MATTERS\n\n\nWe provide warranties on the vehicles we sell.  Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.  Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period.  We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws.  Remedies under these statutes may include vehicle repurchase, civil penalties, and payment by Ford of the plaintiff's attorneys' fees.  In some cases, plaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud.  Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission, vehicle repurchase, and punitive damages.\n\n\nThe cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs.  We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the time of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.\n\n\nWe are currently a defendant in a significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles, including those equipped with DPS6 transmissions.\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\n\nWe have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we (along with others) are or may be a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling, or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for natural resource damages.  We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites.  The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be significant.  Any legal proceeding arising under any federal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party, and (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of $1,000,000 is described herein.\n\n\nOn June 16, 2022, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\"NJDEP\") filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey (Bergen County) seeking natural resource damages and other claims related to the Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site located in Ringwood, New Jersey.  On February 21, 2023, the court denied our motion to dismiss.  We continue to defend against the NJDEP's allegations.\n\n\nCLASS ACTIONS\n\n\nIn light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts as class actions, in general we list those actions that (i) have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction (and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class), and (ii) have more than a remote risk of loss, and such loss would likely be significant if the action is resolved unfavorably to us.  At this time, we have no such class actions filed against us.\n\n\nOTHER MATTERS\n\n\nBrazilian Tax Matters.One Brazilian state (S\u00e3o Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. (\"Ford Brazil\") related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia.  The S\u00e3o Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil.  The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution.  Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under that framework.  The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation.\n\n\nAll of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction.  To proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral.  To date, we have not been required to post any collateral.  If we are required to post collateral, which could be in excess of $1 billion, we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of credit, but we may be required to post cash collateral.  Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote.\n\n\n35\n\n\nTransit Connect Customs Penalty Notice.U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty applicable to passenger vehicles.  We filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade (\"CIT\"), and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017.  CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of CBP.  Following the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of our petition for a writ of certiorari in 2020, we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports, plus interest, and disclosed that CBP might assert a claim for penalties.  Subsequently, CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22, 2021, and on November 18, 2021, CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of $1.3 billion and additional duties of $181 million, plus interest.  We are vigorously defending our actions and contesting payment of the penalty and the additional duties.\n\n\nEuropean Commission and U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Matter.On March 15, 2022, the European Commission (the \"Commission\") and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the \"CMA\") conducted unannounced inspections at the premises of, and sent formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector, including Ford.  The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection, treatment, and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans (\"ELVs\").  We understand that the scope of the investigations includes determining whether manufacturers and importers of passenger cars and vans agreed to an approach to (i) the compensation of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in marketing materials, and whether such conduct violates relevant competition laws.  If a violation is found, a broad range of remedies is potentially available to the Commission and/or CMA, including imposing a fine and/or the prohibition or restriction of certain business practices.  Given that this investigation is in its early stages, it is difficult to predict the outcome or what remedies, if any, may be imposed.  We are cooperating with the Commission and the CMA as they complete their investigations.Not applicable.\n\n\n36Our executive officers are as follows, along with each executive officer's position and age at February 1, 2024:\n\n\nName\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nPositionHeld Since\n\n\nAge\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford, Jr. (a)\n\n\nExecutive Chair and Chair of the Board\n\n\nSeptember 2006\n\n\n66\n\n\nJames D.

As of February 2, 2024, stockholders of record of Ford included approximately 100,089 holders of Common Stock and 3 holders of Class B Stock.  We believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our Common Stock is held in \"street name\" by brokers.\n\n\nStock Performance Graph\n\n\nThe information contained in this Stock Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be \"soliciting material\" or \"filed\" or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\n\n\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our Common Stock with the total return on the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Automobiles & Parts Titans 30 Index for the five year period ended December 31, 2023.

Although we have repurchased 31 million shares and the program was authorized for up to 51 million, we do not intend to make any further purchases under this program because its anti-dilutive purpose has been fulfilled.\n\n\nIn December 2023, our Board of Directors approved a modest anti-dilutive share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of share-based compensation expected to be granted during 2024.  The program authorizes repurchases of up to 53 million shares of Ford Common Stock.  The Company may repurchase shares of Common Stock from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions.  The timing and total amount of repurchases of Ford Common Stock under this program will depend upon business, economic, and market conditions, corporate, legal, and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, trading volume, and other considerations.  The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any amount of Common Stock.  To the extent the Company elects to make purchases under the share repurchase program, the Company expects to utilize its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund such repurchases.\n\n\nDividends\n\n\nThe table below shows the dividends we paid per share of Common and Class B Stock for each quarterly period in 2022 and 2023:\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nFirstQuarter\n\n\nSecondQuarter\n\n\nThirdQuarter\n\n\nFourthQuarter\n\n\nFirst\n\n\nQuarter(a)\n\n\nSecondQuarter\n\n\nThirdQuarter\n\n\nFourthQuarter\n\n\nDividends per share of Ford Common and Class B Stock\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)In the first quarter of 2023, in addition to a regular dividend of $0.15 per share, we paid a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share.\n\n\nOn February 6, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of $0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share.\n\n\nSubject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock.  The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.39Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry\n\n\nProduction and Supply Chain.Although we saw improvements in our supply chain throughout 2023, including easing of the semiconductor shortage, we continue to face some production issues due to, among other things, labor shortages at our suppliers.  Moreover, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base related to inflationary pressure and production disruption.  Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, in order to ensure continuity of supply and mitigate the impact on our production, have made payments to our suppliers, sometimes under duress.  We continue to reevaluate our supply base and sourcing decisions and may in the future incur charges to improve flexibility and cost competitiveness.\n\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate Volatility.Globally, central banks have begun shifting from tightening policy by raising interest rates to holding rates steady or, in some markets, beginning to cut rates.  As they do, they need to carefully balance the risk that inflation remains elevated against the heightened financial and economic risks associated with high interest rates.  This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates.  In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets.  In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile.  However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments.\n\n\nPricing Pressure.Despite vehicle pricing remaining elevated over the last year due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs, we have already observed moderation in the rate of new and used vehicle price increases as auto production recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.  Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets.\n\n\nElectric Vehicle Market.Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption.As a result of the lower-than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we recorded about $0.7 billion of charges in 2023 and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters.See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles.\n\n\nCommodity and Energy Prices.Prices for commodities remain volatile.  In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain elevated.  The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall.  To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements.  Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions.  In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices.\n\n\nVehicle Profitability.Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line.  In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles.  For example, in Ford Blue, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 139% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins.  In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.\n\n\n40\n\n\nTrade Policy.To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets.  While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address the developing role that geopolitical, climate, and labor concerns are playing in trade relations.\n\n\nInflation and Interest Rates.We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of geopolitical volatility, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates.  Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households.  Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets.  Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business.  At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nCompany excluding Ford Credit revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, accessories, and services from our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments.  Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors).  For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity.  Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed.  Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease.  Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer.\n\n\nMost of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit.  Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer's purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Ford entity in payment of the dealer's obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle.  The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer.\n\n\nOur Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases.  Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs.  Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n\nTransactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers' customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded.  In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer's customer.  Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation.  See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments.\n\n\n41\n\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\n\nOur income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories:  (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses.  We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following:  material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs.  We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.\n\n\nCertain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production.  In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.  Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches).  Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.\n\n\nAs a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels.  We analyze these cost changes in the following categories:\n\n\n\u2022Contribution Costs\u2013 these costs typically vary with production volume.  These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs.\n\n\n\u2022Structural Costs\u2013 these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.  These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs.\n\n\nWhile contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume.  We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs.  For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions.  On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases.  Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.  Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors.\n\n\nWe consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue.  For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share.\n\n\nCost of salesandSelling, administrative, and other expensesfor full year 2023 were $161.3 billion.  Company excluding Ford Credit's total material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs.  Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs.\n\n\n42\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023\n\n\nThe net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was $4,347 million in 2023.  Company adjusted EBIT was $10,416 million.\n\n\nNet income/(loss) includes certain items (\"special items\") that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT.  These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results.

The EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing, lower commodity costs, and higher wholesales.  Partial offsets primarily include higher material costs (related to inflationary cost pressures, new products, and about $80 million of volume-related obligations for batteries), higher warranty costs (reflecting inflationary cost pressures and increased field service actions), and higher structural costs (including volume-related) and supplemental compensation (including the impact of the new UAW collective bargaining agreement).\n\n\n46\n\n\nDefinitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors\n\n\nIn general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange:\n\n\n\u2022Market Factors(exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units):\n\n\n\u25e6Volume and Mix\u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line\n\n\n\u25e6Net Pricing\u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory\n\n\n\u2022Cost:\n\n\n\u25e6Contribution Costs\u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs\n\n\n\u25e6Structural Costs\u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.  Structural costs include the following cost categories:\n\n\n\u25aaManufacturing, Including Volume-Related- consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense.  These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules\n\n\n\u25aaEngineering and Connectivity\u2013consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services\n\n\n\u25aaSpending-Related\u2013consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases\n\n\n\u25aaAdvertising and Sales Promotions\u2013includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows\n\n\n\u25aaAdministrative, Information Technology, and Selling\u2013includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions\n\n\n\u25aaPension and OPEB\u2013consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs\n\n\n\u2022Exchange\u2013 primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following:  (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging\n\n\n\u2022Other\u2013includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes\n\n\nIn addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include:\n\n\n\u2022Wholesales and Revenue\u2013 wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. (\"JMC\"), that are sold to dealerships or others.  Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes.  Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue\n\n\n\u2022Industry Volume and Market Share\u2013 based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks\n\n\n\u2022SAAR\u2013 seasonally adjusted annual rate\n\n\n47\n\n\nFord Next Segment\n\n\nThe Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments.\n\n\nIn this segment, our 2023 EBIT loss was $138 million, a $788 million improvement from a year ago.  Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford.\n\n\n48\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nThe tables below provide full year 2023 key metrics and the change in full year 2023 EBT compared with full year 2022 by causal factor for the Ford Credit segment.

Ford Credit's loss metrics continue to normalize from historic lows.  Ford Credit's U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 7% from a year ago.  We are planning for full year 2024 auction values to decrease as vehicle availability continues to improve.\n\n\nFord Credit's 2023 EBT of $1,331 million was $1,326 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, non-recurrence of supplemental depreciation and credit loss reserve releases, lower lease residual performance, unfavorable derivative market valuation, and higher credit losses.\n\n\n49\n\n\nDefinitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors\n\n\nIn general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit's EBT using the causal factors listed below:\n\n\n\u2022Volume and Mix:\n\n\n\u25e6Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates.  Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding\n\n\n\u25e6Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit's average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region\n\n\n\u2022Financing Margin:\n\n\n\u25e6Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates.  This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated.  Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period\n\n\n\u25e6Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense.  Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment.  Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management\n\n\n\u2022Credit Loss:\n\n\n\u25e6Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates.  For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses\n\n\n\u25e6Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries.  Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit's present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions.  For additional information, refer to the \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses\" section of Item 7\n\n\n\u2022Lease Residual:\n\n\n\u25e6Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates.  For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation\n\n\n\u25e6Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold.  Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit's estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit's estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold.  Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events.  For additional information, refer to the \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases\" section of Item 7\n\n\n\u2022Exchange:\n\n\n\u25e6Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars\n\n\n\u2022Other:\n\n\n\u25e6Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates\n\n\n\u25e6Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts\n\n\n\u25e6In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items\n\n\n50\n\n\nIn addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report:\n\n\n\u2022Cash(as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities\n\n\n\u2022Debt(as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) \u2013 Debt on Ford Credit's balance sheets.  Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions\n\n\n\u2022Earnings Before Taxes (\"EBT\") \u2013 Reflects Ford Credit's income before income taxes\n\n\n\u2022Loss-to-Receivables (\"LTR\") Ratio\u2013 LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses\n\n\n\u2022Return on Equity (\"ROE\") (as shown in the Key Metrics table) \u2013 Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period\n\n\n\u2022Securitization and Restricted Cash(as shown in the Liquidity table) \u2013 Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund).  Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements\n\n\n\u2022Securitizations(as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) \u2013 Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada\n\n\n\u2022Term Asset-Backed Securities(as shown in the Funding Structure table) \u2013 Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements\n\n\n\u2022Total Net Receivables(as shown in the Key Metrics table) \u2013 Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment.  These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit's balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit's other creditors\n\n\n51\n\n\nCorporate Other\n\n\nCorporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending.  Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.  These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company's interests.  For full year 2023, Corporate Other had a $760 million EBIT loss, compared with $748 million of positive EBIT in 2022.  The EBIT deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income, reflecting higher interest rates.\n\n\nInterest on Debt\n\n\nInterest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.  Our full year 2023 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $1,302 million, $43 million higher than in 2022.\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\nOurProvision for/(Benefit from) income taxesfor full year 2023 was a $362 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 9.1%.  This includes benefits arising from U.S. research tax credits and legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China.\n\n\nOur full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 10.0%.\n\n\nWe regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return.  Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances.\n\n\n52\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022\n\n\nThe net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was $1,981 million in 2022.  Company adjusted EBIT was $10,415 million.\n\n\nNet income/(loss) includes certain items (\"special items\") that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT.  These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Ford Credit's loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values.  Ford Credit's U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 5% from 2021, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage.\n\n\nFord Credit's 2022 EBT of $2,657 million was $2,060 million lower than 2021, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates.\n\n\n57\n\n\nCorporate Other\n\n\nFor full year 2022, Corporate Other EBIT was $748 million, compared with EBIT of $1,247 million in 2021.  The deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income.\n\n\nInterest on Debt\n\n\nOur full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $1,259 million, $544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022.\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\nOurProvision for/(Benefit from) income taxesfor full year 2022 was a $864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6%.

Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business.  At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of $28.8 billion and liquidity of $46.4 billion.  At December 31, 2023, about 90% of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States.\n\n\nTo be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above $20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target.  We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to:  (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment.\n\n\nOur Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions.  The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs.  We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis.\n\n\n59\n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements.Our material cash requirements include:\n\n\n\u2022Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the \"Changes in Company Cash\" section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles\n\n\n\u2022Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our \"Purchase obligations\" below)\n\n\n\u2022Marketing incentive payments to dealers\n\n\n\u2022Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements)\n\n\n\u2022Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements)\n\n\n\u2022Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the \"Changes in Company Cash\" section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements)\n\n\n\u2022Employee wages, benefits, and incentives\n\n\n\u2022Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements)\n\n\n\u2022Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business\n\n\n\u2022Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification\n\n\nSubject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash.  We target shareholder distributions of 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow.  Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters.\n\n\nWe are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash.  Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment.  In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services.  These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements.  \"Purchase obligations\" in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the \"Purchase obligations,\" our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected pension contributions.\n\n\n(f)Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above.  As of December 31, 2023, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately $4.5 billion of purchase obligations and approximately $8 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast.  However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate.  The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase.  In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements.  For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62.\n\n\nWe plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements.\n\n\nChanges in Company Cash.In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items.  Operating items include:  Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows).  Non-operating items include:  restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit).\n\n\n61\n\n\nWith respect to \"Changes in working capital,\" in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced.  In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days.  As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due.  Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days.  For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow.  Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.  For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.  The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.\n\n\nOur finished product inventory at December 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher in-transit inventory.\n\n\nIn response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles.  Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.  Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026.  Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities.  Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.\n\n\nThe terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time.  The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery.  The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output.  Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism.  Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.\n\n\nUnlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers.  Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains its obligation for the cost of those materials.For additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\n\nFinancial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (\"SCF\") program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide.  Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity.  We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it.  As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was $220 million.  The amount settled through the SCF program during 2023 was $1.8 billion.\n\n\n62\n\n\nChanges in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nCompany Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n9.1\n\n\nCapital spending\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6.2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6.5)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(8.2)\n\n\nDepreciation and tooling amortization\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n5.3\n\n\nNet spending\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.3)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.9)\n\n\nReceivables\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\nInventory\n\n\n(1.8)\n\n\n(2.5)\n\n\n(1.2)\n\n\nTrade Payables\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n(0.2)\n\n\nChanges in working capital\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.7)\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.4)\n\n\nFord Credit distributions\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nInterest on debt and cash taxes\n\n\n(2.3)\n\n\n(1.7)\n\n\n(2.2)\n\n\nAll other and timing differences\n\n\n(3.1)\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n5.2\n\n\nCompany adjusted free cash flow (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n$\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n6.8\n\n\nRestructuring\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.9)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.9)\n\n\nChanges in debt\n\n\n(3.7)\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\n(0.2)\n\n\nFunded pension contributions\n\n\n(0.8)\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\nShareholder distributions\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\n(2.5)\n\n\n(5.3)\n\n\nAll other (b)\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n(9.5)\n\n\n(3.2)\n\n\nChange in cash\n\n\n$\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n(4.3)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3.4)\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)SeeNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliationssection for reconciliation to GAAP.\n\n\n(b)2021 includes our investment in Rivian of $10.6 billion and cash premium paid of $(1.6) billion associated with repurchasing and redeeming $7.6 billion of higher-coupon debt.  2022 includes a $7.4 billion loss on our Rivian investment.  2023 includes $2.6 billion of capital contributions to BlueOval SK, LLC.\n\n\nNote:  Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nOur full year 2023Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activitieswas positive $14.9 billion, an increase of $8.1 billion from a year ago (see page 78 for additional information).  The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher net income.\n\n\nCompany adjusted free cash flow was $6.8 billion, $2.3 billion lower than a year ago.  An improvement in Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and timing differences were more than offset by the non-repeat of working capital improvements and Ford Credit distributions, as well as higher capital spending.\n\n\nCapital spending was $8.2 billion in 2023, $1.6 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of $8 billion to $9.5 billion in 2024.\n\n\nThe full year 2023 working capital impact was $2.4 billion negative, driven by an increase in inventory and receivables.  All other and timing differences were positive $5.2 billion.  Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense).\n\n\nShareholder distributions (including cash dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were $5.3 billion in 2023.  On February 6, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of $0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share.\n\n\n63\n\n\nAvailable Credit Lines.Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2023 were $19.4 billion, consisting of $13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, $2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, $1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and $2.2 billion of local credit facilities.  At December 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was $18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit.  In addition, $1.8 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nLenders under our corporate credit facility have $3.4 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026 and $10.1 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028.  Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have $0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and $1.9 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026.  Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have $1.8 billion of commitments maturing on April 24, 2024.\n\n\nOn August 17, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day revolving credit facility, with $4 billion of commitments maturing on August 15, 2024.  At the time we entered into this credit facility, it provided additional working capital flexibility to manage through uncertainties in the present environment, including a potential labor disruption.  With the ratification of the new UAW contract, this credit facility was terminated as of November 24, 2023.\n\n\nThe corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO2tailpipe emissions.  Ford outperformed the 2022 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which favorably impacted pricing beginning in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\nThe corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment.  The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility.  The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility.  Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.\n\n\nEach of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody's, and S&P.  On October 30, 2023, following the upgrade by S&P of our senior, unsecured, long-term debt credit rating to BBB-, the unsecured guarantees provided by the following subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facilities were released:  Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc.\n\n\nDebt.As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $19.9 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2022.\n\n\nLeverage.We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle.  The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit).\n\n\nFord Credit's leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the \"Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment\" section of Item 7.  Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit.\n\n\n64\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nFord Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets.  Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, and ended 2023 with $25.7 billion of liquidity, up $4.6 billion from 2022.\n\n\nKey elements of Ford Credit's funding strategy include:\n\n\n\u2022Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity\n\n\n\u2022Prudently access public markets\n\n\n\u2022Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe\n\n\n\u2022Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity\n\n\n\u2022Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1\n\n\n\u2022Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet\n\n\nFord Credit's liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements.  Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles.\n\n\nFunding Sources.Ford Credit's funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings).  Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months.  Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets.\n\n\nFord Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc (\"FCE\") and Ford Bank GmbH (\"Ford Bank\").  At December 31, 2023, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was $17.2 billion.  Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations.\n\n\nThe following table shows funding for Ford Credit's net receivables (in billions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nFunding Structure\n\n\nTerm unsecured debt\n\n\n$\n\n\n59.4\n\n\n$\n\n\n48.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n54.1\n\n\nTerm asset-backed securities\n\n\n45.4\n\n\n56.4\n\n\n58.0\n\n\nRetail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage\n\n\n12.9\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n17.2\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(0.1)\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nEquity\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n13.4\n\n\nAdjustments for cash\n\n\n(12.5)\n\n\n(11.3)\n\n\n(10.9)\n\n\nTotal Net Receivables\n\n\n$\n\n\n117.5\n\n\n$\n\n\n122.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n133.2\n\n\nSecuritized Funding as Percent of Total Debt\n\n\n38.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n47.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n44.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nNet receivables of $133.2 billion at December 31, 2023 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities.

At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit's net liquidity available for use was $25.7 billion, $4.6 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of $5.5 billion in committed asset-backed capacity.  Ford Credit's sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities.  At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit's liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled $56.2 billion, up $5.2 billion from year-end 2022.\n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements.Ford Credit's material cash requirements include:  (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the \"Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile\" section below, the \"Material Cash Requirements\" section in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit\" above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements).  In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit's Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash.  Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters.\n\n\nFord Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements.\n\n\n66\n\n\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile.Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods.  Ford Credit's balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash.  Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities.  This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios.\n\n\nThe following table shows Ford Credit's cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions):\n\n\n2024\n\n\n2025\n\n\n2026\n\n\n2027 and Beyond\n\n\nBalance Sheet Liquidity Profile\n\n\nAssets (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n76\n\n\n$\n\n\n104\n\n\n$\n\n\n126\n\n\n$\n\n\n149\n\n\nTotal debt (b)\n\n\n61\n\n\n88\n\n\n105\n\n\n131\n\n\nMemo:  Unsecured long-term debt maturities\n\n\n12\n\n\n13\n\n\n11\n\n\n21\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation toTrade and other receivables), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities).  Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments.\n\n\n(b)Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments.\n\n\nMaturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination.  Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit's retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases.  The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities.\n\n\nAll wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2024.  The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period.  As of December 31, 2023, Ford Credit had $149 billion of assets, $68 billion of which were unencumbered.\n\n\nFunding and Liquidity Risks.Ford Credit's funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets.\n\n\nDespite Ford Credit's diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence):\n\n\n\u2022Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets;\n\n\n\u2022Global capital markets volatility;\n\n\n\u2022Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit;\n\n\n\u2022Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments;\n\n\n\u2022General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers;\n\n\n\u2022Ford Credit's ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures;\n\n\n\u2022Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit's asset-backed financing structures;\n\n\n\u2022Inability to obtain hedging instruments;\n\n\n\u2022Accounting and regulatory changes; and\n\n\n\u2022Ford Credit's ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities.\n\n\nStress Tests.Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events.  Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity.  These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term.  Ford Credit's stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford.  Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing.\n\n\n67\n\n\nLeverage.Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure.\n\n\nThe table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit's financial statement leverage (in billions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nLeverage Calculation\n\n\nDebt\n\n\n$\n\n\n117.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n119.0\n\n\n$\n\n\n129.3\n\n\nEquity (a)\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n13.4\n\n\nFinancial statement leverage (to 1)\n\n\n9.5\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Total shareholder's interest reported on Ford Credit's balance sheets.\n\n\nFord Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business.  At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit's financial statement leverage was 9.7:1.  Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1.\n\n\n68\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\nPension Plan Contributions and Strategy.Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans.  The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile.  Going forward, we expect to:\n\n\n\u2022Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost, ensure our funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, and meet regulatory requirements, if any;\n\n\n\u2022Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and\n\n\n\u2022Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2023\n\n\nH / (L)\n\n\n2022\n\n\nPension Funded Status($B)\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.3)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1.4)\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\nTotal Global Pension\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.3)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.1)\n\n\nYear-End Discount Rate(Weighted Average)\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\n5.51\n\n\n%\n\n\n5.17\n\n\n%\n\n\n(34) bps\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\n4.42\n\n\n%\n\n\n3.98\n\n\n%\n\n\n(44) bps\n\n\nActual Asset Returns\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\n(21.20)\n\n\n%\n\n\n7.41\n\n\n%\n\n\n28.61 ppts\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\n(25.40)\n\n\n%\n\n\n5.56\n\n\n%\n\n\n30.96 ppts\n\n\nPension - Funded Plans Only($B)\n\n\nFunded Status\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\nContributions for Funded Plans\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nWorldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a deterioration of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022 and pension benefit enhancements as part of the collective bargaining agreements in the United States and Canada, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions.  Of the $2.3 billion underfunded status at year-end 2023, our funded plans were $2.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were $4.4 billion underfunded.  These unfunded plans are \"pay as you go\" with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.\n\n\nThe fixed income mix was 76% in our U.S. plans and 78% in our non-U.S. plans at year-end 2023.\n\n\nIn 2023, we contributed $592 million to our global funded pension plans, an increase of $25 million compared with 2022.  During 2024, we expect to contribute about $1 billion of cash to our global funded pension plans.  We also expect to make about $400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2024.  Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet.\n\n\nFor a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\" section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\n69\n\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\").We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax rolling four quarter average.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity.  Rating agencies' ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources.  Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.  Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.\n\n\nThe following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023:\n\n\n\u2022On October 30, 2023, S&P upgraded the credit ratings for Ford and Ford Credit to BBB- from BB+ and revised the outlook to stable from positive.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:\n\n\nNRSRO RATINGS\n\n\nFord\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\nNRSROs\n\n\nIssuerDefault /Corporate /Issuer Rating\n\n\nLong-Term Senior Unsecured\n\n\nOutlook / Trend\n\n\nLong-Term Senior Unsecured\n\n\nShort-TermUnsecured\n\n\nOutlook / Trend\n\n\nMinimum  Long-Term Investment Grade Rating\n\n\nDBRS\n\n\nBBB (low)\n\n\nBBB (low)\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB (low)\n\n\nR-2 (low)\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB (low)\n\n\nFitch\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nF3\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nMoody's\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nBa1\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBa1\n\n\nNP\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBaa3\n\n\nS&P\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\nA-3\n\n\nStable\n\n\nBBB-\n\n\n71\n\n\nOUTLOOK\n\n\nWe provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated February 6, 2024.  The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 6, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions.  Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I.\n\n\n2024 Guidance\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\nAdjusted EBIT (a)\n\n\n$10 - $12 billion\n\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (a)\n\n\n$6 - $7 billion\n\n\nCapital spending\n\n\n$8 - $9.5 billion\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\nEBT\n\n\nAbout $1.5 billion\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in \"Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures,\" they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty.\n\n\nFor full-year 2024, we expect adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion.\n\n\nOn a segment basis, we expect:\n\n\n\u2022Ford Pro EBIT of $8 billion to $9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing\n\n\n\u2022Ford Blue EBIT of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150 launch; we also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies\n\n\n\u2022Ford Model e EBIT loss of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, primarily driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in next generation vehicles\n\n\n\u2022Ford Credit EBT of about $1.5 billion\n\n\nOur outlook for 2024 assumes:\n\n\n\u2022Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million\n\n\n\u2022Non-recurrence of the UAW strike\n\n\n\u2022Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro\n\n\n\u2022Lower industry pricing as supply and demand normalize\n\n\n\u2022$2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives, offsetting higher labor and major product refresh actions\n\n\n72\n\n\nCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements\n\n\nStatements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation:\n\n\n\u2022Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford's production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford's production of vehicles;\n\n\n\u2022To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business;\n\n\n\u2022Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies;\n\n\n\u2022Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation;\n\n\n\u2022Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's production, as well as Ford's suppliers' production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors;\n\n\n\u2022Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford's business;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced;\n\n\n\u2022Ford's results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States;\n\n\n\u2022With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford's results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events;\n\n\n\u2022Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event;\n\n\n\u2022Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles;\n\n\n\u2022Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit's investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results;\n\n\n\u2022Ford and Ford Credit's access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors;\n\n\n\u2022The impact of government incentives on Ford's business could be significant, and Ford's receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback;\n\n\n\u2022Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles;\n\n\n\u2022Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed;\n\n\n\u2022Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford's liquidity and financial condition;\n\n\n\u2022Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise;\n\n\n\u2022Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations;\n\n\n\u2022Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers' heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and\n\n\n\u2022Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.\n\n\n73\n\n\nWe cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized.  It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results.  Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  For additional discussion, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" above.\n\n\n74\n\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES\n\n\nWe use both generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance.  The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results.  We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.\n\n\n\u2022Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford)\u2013 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items.  This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results.  Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.  Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:\n\n\nPre-Tax Special Item\n\n\nSignificance Guideline\n\n\n\u2218  Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses\n\n\n\u2218  No minimum\n\n\n\u2218  Gains and losses on investments in equity securities\n\n\n\u2218  No minimum\n\n\n\u2218  Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix\n\n\n\u2218  Generally $100 million or more\n\n\n\u2218  Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities\n\n\n\u2218  $500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally $100 million or more for other items\n\n\nWhen we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.\n\n\n\u2022Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin)\u2013 Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue.  This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.\n\n\n\u2022Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Earnings/(Loss) Per Share)\u2013 Measure of Company's diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests.  The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.  When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.\n\n\n\u2022Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Effective Tax Rate)\u2013 Measure of Company's tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items.  The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting.  When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.\n\n\n75\n\n\n\u2022Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities)\u2013 Measure of Company's operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit's operating cash flows.  The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives.  The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP.  This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management's assessment of the Company's operating cash flow performance.  When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities.\n\n\n\u2022Adjusted ROIC\u2013 Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters.  Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (\"Adjusted ROIC\") provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company's after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented.  Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs.

In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above.  Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n\nWarranties and Field Service Actions\n\n\nNature of Estimates Required.We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.  Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns.  Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship.  We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used.We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model.  We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis.  Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available.  With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages.  We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations.  Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary.\n\n\nField service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period.  We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model.  We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary.\n\n\nDue to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs.\n\n\nPensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\n\n\nNature of Estimates Required.The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases.  Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).\n\n\n83\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used.The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:\n\n\n\u2022Discount rates.Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan.  Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations.\n\n\n\u2022Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan.  Historical returns also are considered when appropriate.  The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.\n\n\n\u2022Salary growth.Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation.\n\n\n\u2022Inflation.Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets.\n\n\n\u2022Expected contributions.Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency).\n\n\n\u2022Retirement rates.Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.\n\n\n\u2022Mortality rates.Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.\n\n\n\u2022Health care cost trends.  Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.\n\n\nAssumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement.\n\n\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions.\n\n\nPension Plans\n\n\nEffect of Actual Results.  The year-end 2023 weighted average discount rate was 5.17% for U.S. plans and 3.98% for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 34 and 44 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2022.  In 2023, the U.S. actual return on assets was  7.41%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.25%.  Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 5.56%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 4.13%.  The higher returns are explained primarily by gains on fixed income assets.  In total, lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions resulted in a net remeasurement loss of $1.8 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.\n\n\nFor 2024, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 5.93% for U.S. plans, down 32 basis points from 2023, reflecting lower capital market return expectations, and 4.53% for non-U.S. plans, up 40 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting return expectations in those markets and a higher return seeking mix for certain plans.\n\n\nDe-risking Strategy.  We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves.  Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio.  Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates.  Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio.\n\n\n84\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis.The December 31, 2023 pension funded status and 2024 expense are affected by year-end 2023 assumptions.  Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted.  The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below.\n\n\nDiscount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets.  The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):\n\n\nBasisPoint Change\n\n\nIncrease/(Decrease) in\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023 Funded Status\n\n\nFactor\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\nDiscount rate - obligation\n\n\n+/- 100 bps\n\n\n$2,900/$(3,400)\n\n\n$2,700/$(3,400)\n\n\nInterest rate - fixed income assets\n\n\n+/- 100\n\n\n(2,800)/3,200\n\n\n(1,800)/2,200\n\n\nNet impact on funded status\n\n\n$100/$(200)\n\n\n$900/$(1,200)\n\n\nThe fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns.  Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected.\n\n\nInterest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense.  These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year.  The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):\n\n\nBasisPoint Change\n\n\nIncrease/(Decrease) in2024 Pension Expense\n\n\nFactor\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\nInterest rate - service cost and interest cost\n\n\n+/- 25 bps\n\n\n$25/$(25)\n\n\n$15/$(15)\n\n\nExpected long-term rate of return on assets\n\n\n+/- 25\n\n\n(75)/75\n\n\n(55)/55\n\n\nThe effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities.  The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear.\n\n\nOther Postretirement Employee Benefits\n\n\nEffect of Actual Results.  The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2023 was 5.10%, compared with 5.48% at December 31, 2022, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement loss of $286 million, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis.Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense.

We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas:  (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n\n85\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used.We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation.  We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions.  If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized.  This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes.  We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities.  Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred.\n\n\nWe must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\n\n\nThis assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following:\n\n\n\u2022Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses.A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence.  We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability.  We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors.  In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations;\n\n\n\u2022Sources of future taxable income.Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence.  Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated.  Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved.  In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and\n\n\n\u2022Tax planning strategies.If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards.  These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted.\n\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits.  We presently believe that global valuation allowances of $4.2 billion are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining $16 billion of deferred tax assets.  However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position.  Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods.\n\n\nFor additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\n86\n\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\n\nAsset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting.  Following the organizational and segment structure change in the beginning of 2023, our asset groups are: Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next.\n\n\nNature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets.We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping.  In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term.  In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment.  In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan.  If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed.\n\n\nWhen a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group's fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method.  To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.  When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets.The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group.\n\n\nWe measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available.  When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach.  The income approach uses cash flow projections.  Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value.  We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data.  Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.\n\n\nChanges in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results.  The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections:\n\n\n\u2022Business projections.We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace.  These\n\n\nassumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing.  We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance).  These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors.\n\n\n\u2022Long-term growth rate.A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows.  The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group's earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period.\n\n\n\u2022Discount rate.When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use.  Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\n\n\n87\n\n\n\u2022Economic projections.Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles.  These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n\nThe market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of an asset group.  This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the asset group being evaluated.  In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes.\n\n\nDuring 2023, we identified triggering events related to our Ford Blue Europe asset group.  In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable.  If, in future quarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets.\n\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit's estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of Ford Credit's allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly.  Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.  Changes in assumptions affectFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenseson our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained withinFord Credit finance receivables, neton our consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses.\n\n\nNature of Estimates Required.Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment.  The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions.  The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans.  If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\n\n\n88\n\n\nAssumptions Used.Ford Credit's allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding:\n\n\n\u2022Probability of default.  The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and\n\n\n\u2022Loss given default.The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable.  The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries.\n\n\nMacroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit's models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product.\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis.Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit's U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions):\n\n\nAssumption\n\n\nBasis Point Change\n\n\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n\n\nProbability of default (lifetime)\n\n\n+/- 100 bps\n\n\n$230/$(230)\n\n\nLoss given default\n\n\n+/- 100\n\n\n10/(10)\n\n\nAccumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit's operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term.\n\n\nFord Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis.  If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit's revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term.  Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.\n\n\nGenerally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer.\n\n\nNature of Estimates Required.Each operating lease in Ford Credit's portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer.  At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle.  Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data.\n\n\nAssumptions Used.Ford Credit's accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding:\n\n\n\u2022Auction value.Ford Credit's projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and\n\n\n\u2022Return volume.Ford Credit's projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end.\n\n\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases.\n\n\n89\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis.For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle.  The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract.  A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit's estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit's U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions):\n\n\nAssumption\n\n\nBasis Point\n\n\nChange\n\n\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n\n\nFuture auction values\n\n\n+/- 100 bps\n\n\n$(20)/$20\n\n\nReturn volumes\n\n\n+/- 100\n\n\n5/(5)\n\n\nAdjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets asNet investment in operating leasesand on our income statements inFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses.\n\n\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED\n\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\n90OVERVIEW\n\n\nWe are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks.\n\n\nWe monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee (\"GRMC\").  The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and the committee includes our Controller and Treasurer.\n\n\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk, including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable.  Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles.  As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings, unsecured debt issuances, equity and equity-linked issuances, and bank borrowings.\n\n\nWe are exposed to a variety of other risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury.  We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our self-insured retentions against events that could generate significant losses.\n\n\nDirect responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurer's Office and is governed by written policies and procedures.  Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows.  Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective.  In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC, and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\n\nIn accordance with our corporate risk management policies, we use derivative instruments, when available, such as forward contracts, swaps, and options that economically hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest rates).  We do not use derivative contracts for trading, market-making, or speculative purposes.  In certain instances, we forgo hedge accounting, and in certain other instances, our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.  Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income.  For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\n\nThe market and counterparty risks of the Company excluding Ford Credit as well as our Ford Credit segment are discussed and quantified below.\n\n\nCOMPANY EXCLUDING FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK\n\n\nWe frequently have expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following:  purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates.  We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates.\n\n\nForeign currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous, parallel shifts in rates and/or prices.\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk.Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates.  Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy.  In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts).  The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.\n\n\n91\n\n\nThe net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2023, was a liability of $319 million, compared with an asset of $236 million as of December 31, 2022.  The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022.  The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies.  In reality, some of our exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.  See Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.\n\n\nCommodity Price Risk.Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries.  Our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities consistent with our overall risk management strategy.  In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts).  The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.\n\n\nThe net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2023, was a liability of $9 million, compared with a liability of $49 million as of December 31, 2022.  The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $203 million at December 31, 2023, compared with $178 million at December 31, 2022.  The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities.  In reality, commodity prices move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.\n\n\nIn addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials.  In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk.Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.  Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.  At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of $28.8 billion in our investment portfolios, compared to $32.3 billion at December 31, 2022.  We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.  The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.  In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk-adjusted return is the secondary objective.\n\n\nAt any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.  Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $222 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2023.  This compares to $256 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2022.  While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.  The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.  In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.\n\n\n92\n\n\nFORD CREDIT MARKET RISK\n\n\nMarket risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk.  Generally, Ford Credit's assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.\n\n\nFord Credit's assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.  Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.  Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers' inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.\n\n\nDebt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt.  Ford Credit's term debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity.\n\n\nFord Credit's interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market.  Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.  It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit's exposure falls within the established tolerances.  Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.  The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit's interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.  Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly.\n\n\nTo provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a \"parallel shift\"), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.  In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit's analysis.  As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit's view of future interest rate movements.\n\n\nUnder these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next twelve months.  Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on Ford Credit's assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit's debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit's pre-tax cash flow.  During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.  Ford Credit's pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nPre-Tax Cash Flow Sensitivity\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nOne percentage point instantaneousincreasein interest rates\n\n\n$\n\n\n127\n\n\n$\n\n\n78\n\n\nOne percentage point instantaneousdecreasein interest rates\n\n\n(127)\n\n\n(78)\n\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit's best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.  The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.  Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.  Ford Credit's repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.  If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit's actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.\n\n\n93\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk.Ford Credit's policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.  To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, and renminbi.  Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.  When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.  When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.  As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2023, is insignificant.\n\n\nDerivative Fair Values.The net fair value of Ford Credit's derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2023 was a liability of $1.3 billion, compared to a liability of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022.\n\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\n\nCounterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.  We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.  Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.  We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.\n\n\nOur approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.  Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (\"CDS\") spreads.  The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures.  Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.\n\n\nSubstantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating.  Investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long-term ratings.The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, our Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements, and the Financial Statement Schedule that are filed as part of this Report are listed under \"Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\" and are set forth beginning on page105immediately following the signature pages of this Report.None.\n\n\n94Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.James D. Farley, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), and John T. Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), have performed an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\"), as of December 31, 2023, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f).  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.  The assessment was based on criteria established in the frameworkInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited byPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP(PCAOB ID238), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Companyadopted, modified, orterminateda \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or a \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.Not applicable.\n\n\n95The information required by Item 10 regarding our directors is incorporated by reference from the information under the captions \"Proposal 1.

OSGOOD\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\n\nJonathan E. Osgood\n\n\nAttorney-in-Fact\n\n\n104\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ford Motor Company\n\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\n105\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\nFord Credit Consumer Finance Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses\n\n\nAs described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had consumer finance receivables of $78,274 million, for which a consumer allowance for credit losses of $879 million was recorded as of December 31, 2023.  The consumer allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment.  The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable's original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.  If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and management's judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company's determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions; (iv) testing the data used in the models; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management's judgment regarding qualitative factors related to economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing the procedures described in (i) through (v).\n\n\n106\n\n\nWarranty and Field Service Actions Accrual (United States)\n\n\nAs described in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accrual for estimated future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries (\"warranty accrual\"), of $11,504 million as of December 31, 2023, of which the United States comprises a significant portion.  Management accrues the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  Management establishes their estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  Management establishes their estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the estimate of the warranty accrual for the United States.  These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management to develop the warranty accrual for the United States, related to the frequency and average cost of claims, in part by considering the historical experience of the Company.

We reclassified certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n\nCertain Transactions with Ford Credit\n\n\nTransactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business.Additional detail regarding certain of those transactions is below (in billions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n\nTrade and other receivables (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n10.6\n\n\n$\n\n\n9.2\n\n\nUnearned interest supplements and residual support (b)\n\n\n(3.4)\n\n\n(4.6)\n\n\nOther (c)\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro receivables (generated primarily from vehicle and parts sales to third parties) sold to Ford Credit.\n\n\n(b)Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro pay amounts to Ford Credit at the point of retail financing or lease origination, which represent interest supplements and residual support.\n\n\n(c)Includes a sale-leaseback agreement between Ford Blue and Ford Credit relating primarily to vehicles that we lease to our employees.\n\n\nSee Note 2 for additional information regarding our finance and lease incentives between Ford Credit and our other segments.\n\n\n113\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\nFor each accounting topic that is addressed in its own note, the description of the accounting policy may be found in the related note.  Other significant accounting policies are described below.\n\n\nUse of Estimates\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results.  Estimates are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty costs, employee benefit programs, allowance for credit losses, and other items requiring judgment.  Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.\n\n\nForeign Currency\n\n\nWhen an entity has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from its functional currency, we remeasure those assets and liabilities from the transactional currency to the entity's functional currency.  The effect of this remeasurement process and the results of our related foreign currency hedging activities are reported inCost of salesandOther income/(loss), netand were $(74) million, $180million, and $13million for the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nGenerally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency.  We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates.  Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are recognized inForeign currency translation, a component ofOther comprehensive income/(Ioss), net of tax.Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, the amount of accumulated foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to income and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the investment.\n\n\nCash Equivalents\n\n\nCash and cash equivalentsare highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal.  A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.  Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty, are classified asCash and cash equivalents.  Time deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nRestricted Cash\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded inOther assetsin the non-current assets section of our consolidated balancesheets.  Our Company excluding Ford Credit restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal, insurance, customs, and environmental matters and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements.  Our Ford Credit segment restricted cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatoryreserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements.  Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions.\n\n\n114\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(Continued)\n\n\nMarketable Securities\n\n\nInvestments in debt securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other debt securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal are classified and accounted for as either trading or available-for-sale marketable securities.  Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are classified and accounted for as trading marketable securities.\n\n\nRealized gains and losses, interest income, and dividend income on all of our marketable securities and unrealized gains and losses on securities not classified as available for sale are recorded inOther income/(loss), net.  Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized inUnrealized gains and losses on securities, a component ofOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax.  Realized gains and losses and reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method.\n\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our available-for-sale debt securities for credit losses.  We compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, we determine if a credit loss allowance is necessary.  If a credit loss allowance is necessary, we will record an allowance, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, and recognize the corresponding charge inOther income/(loss), net.  Factors we consider include the severity and reason for the decline in value, interest rate changes, and counterparty long-term ratings.\n\n\nTrade, Notes, and Other Receivables\n\n\nTrade, notes, and other receivables consist primarily of receivables from contracts with customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories.  The current portion of trade and notes receivables is reported inTrade and other receivables, net.  The non-current portion of notes receivables is reported inOther assets.  Trade and notes receivables are initially recorded at transaction cost.  Trade receivables are typically outstanding for30days or less.  Each reporting period, we evaluate the collectibility of the trade and notes receivables and record an allowance for credit losses representing our estimate of the expected losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables.  Additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported inSelling, administrative, and other expensesandCost of sales.  Trade and notes receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the account is deemed to be uncollectible.\n\n\nThe carrying value of trade, notes, and other receivables was $15.9billion and $16.4billion at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The credit loss reserve included in the carrying value of trade, notes, and other receivables was $105million and $86million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nNet Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.  Goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed or a change in reporting units.  We test for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying amount.  If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment, the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with its fair value.  Fair value is measured relying primarily on the income approach by applying a discounted cash flow method, the market approach using market values or multiples, and/or third-party valuations.We capitalize and amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\n\n\nThe carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill is reported inOther assetsin the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.Intangible assets are comprised primarily of advertising agreements and land rights.  The net carrying amount of our intangible assets was $86million and $80million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The net carrying amount of goodwill was $603million and $683million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  For the periods presented, we didnotrecord any material impairments for indefinite-lived intangibles or goodwill.\n\n\n115\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(Continued)\n\n\nHeld-and-Used Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\n\nWe test long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends, a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping.  In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term.  In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment.  In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan.  If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed.\n\n\nWhen a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group's fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method.  To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.  When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.For the periods presented, we havenotrecorded any material impairments.\n\n\nHeld-for-Sale Asset Impairment\n\n\nWe perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale (\"HFS\"), or otherwise disposed when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year.  We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less cost to sell, and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group.  An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value (see Note 22).  We also assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a disposal group previously classified as HFS upon reclassification as held and used.  When there is a change to a plan of sale, and the assets are reclassified from HFS to held and used, the long-lived assets would be reported at the lower of (i) the carrying amount before HFS designation, adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been classified as HFS, or (ii) the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as HFS.\n\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\n\nWe measure fair value of our financial instruments, including those held within our pension plans, using various valuation methods and prioritize the use of observable inputs.  The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy:\n\n\n\u2022Level 1 - inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable\n\n\n\u2022Level 2 - inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and yield curves\n\n\n\u2022Level 3 - inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instruments\n\n\nFixed income securities, equities, commingled funds, derivative financial instruments, and alternative assets are remeasured and presented within our consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis.  Finance receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure.  Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\n\n\nTransfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period.\n\n\n116\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(Continued)\n\n\nValuation Method\n\n\nFixed Income Securities.  Fixed income securities primarily include government securities, government agency securities, corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities.  We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services or quotes from dealers that make markets in such securities.  Pricing methods and inputs to valuation models used by the pricing services depend on the security type (i.e., asset class).  Where possible, fair values are generated using market inputs, including quoted prices (the closing price in an exchange market), bid prices (the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase), and other market information.  For fixed income securities that are not actively traded, the pricing services use alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities, including quotes for similar fixed income securities, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow using benchmark curves, or other factors.  In certain cases, when market data are not available, we may use broker quotes or pricing services that use proprietary pricing models to determine fair value.  The proprietary models incorporate unobservable inputs primarily consisting of prepayment curves, discount rates, default assumptions, recovery rates, yield assumptions, and credit spread assumptions.\n\n\nAn annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services, which includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities.  We also compare the price of certain securities sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable.\n\n\nEquities.Equity securities are primarily exchange-traded and are valued based on the closing bid, official close, or last trade pricing on an active exchange.  If closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price.  Securities that are thinly traded or delisted are valued using unobservable pricing data.\n\n\nCommingled Funds.Fixed income and public equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund investments.  Most commingled funds are valued to reflect our interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value (\"NAV\").\n\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments.Exchange-traded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded.  Over-the-counter derivatives are not exchange traded and are valued using independent pricing services or industry-standard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow.  When discounted cash flow models are used, projected future cash flows are discounted to a present value using market-based expectations for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments.  The discount rate used is the relevant benchmark interest rate (e.g., SOFR, SONIA) plus an adjustment for non-performance risk.  The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap (\"CDS\") spread applied to a net exposure, by counterparty, considering the master netting agreements we have entered into and any posted collateral.  We use our counterparty's CDS spread when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position.  In cases when market data are not available, we use broker quotes and models (e.g., Black-Scholes) to determine fair value.  This includes situations where there is a lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity, or when the instrument is longer dated.  When broker quotes or models are used to determine fair value, the derivative is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.  All other derivatives are categorized within Level 2.\n\n\nAlternative Assets.Hedge funds generally hold liquid and readily-priced securities, such as public equities, exchange-traded derivatives, and corporate bonds.  Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid.  External investment managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals, which are adjusted for cash flows, and realized and unrealized gains/losses.  All alternative assets are valued at the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator, as they do not have readily-available market quotations.  Valuations may be lagged up to six months.  The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) through year end.  We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV.\n\n\n117\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(Continued)\n\n\nWe may hold annuity contracts within some of our non-U.S. pension plans (see Note 17).  Generally, the contract valuation method is applied for markets where we have purchased annuity contracts from an insurer as a plan asset.  We measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates.  The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based on actuarial estimates.  We include all annuity contracts within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n\n\nFinance Receivables.We measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation models (see Note 10).  These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal and interest) and assumptions regarding expected credit losses and pre-payment speed.  The projected cash flows are discounted to present value at current rates that incorporate present yield curve and credit spread assumptions.  The fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n\n\nOn a nonrecurring basis, we also measure at fair value retail contracts greater than120days past due or deemed to be uncollectible, and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure.  We use the fair value of collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell, to determine the fair value of these receivables.  The collateral for a retail financing or wholesale receivable is the vehicle financed, and for dealer loans is real estate or other property.\n\n\nThe fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated as the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the average recovery value percentage.  The fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market value or liquidation value for new and used vehicles.  The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing various appraisals, which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements, alternate use appraised value, broker's opinion of value, and purchase offers.\n\n\nDebt.We measure debt at fair value using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturities (see Note 19).  Where quoted prices are not available, we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debt instruments.  For certain short-term debt with an original maturity date of one year or less, we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the debt's fair value.  The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy.\n\n\nFinance and Lease Incentives\n\n\nWe routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers' customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration when the vehicle is sold to the dealer.  Ford Credit records a reduction to the finance receivable or reduces the cost of the vehicle operating lease when it records the underlying finance contract, and we transfer to Ford Credit the amount of the incentive on behalf of the dealer's customer.  See Note 1 for additional information regarding transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments.The Ford Credit segment recognized interest revenue of $2.4billion, $2.1billion, and $2.3billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, and lower depreciation of $1.9billion, $1.2billion, and $0.9billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, associated with these incentives.\n\n\nSupplier Price Adjustments\n\n\nWe frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle, even after receiving production material.  These price adjustments relate to changes in design specification or other commercial terms such as economics, productivity, and competitive pricing.  We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers.  In general, we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business; however, when these occur, our policy is to defer the recognition of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business.\n\n\n118\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(Continued)\n\n\nGovernment Incentives\n\n\nWe receive incentives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits, grants, and loans.  Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense or as other income.  The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met and there is reasonable assurance of receipt.  Government incentives related to capital investment are recognized inNet Propertyas a reduction to the net book value of the related asset.  The incentives are recognized over the life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n\nDuring 2022, we were awarded incentives by the State of Tennessee related to land, capital, and property tax abatements in connection with Ford's capital investment in our new electric vehicle assembly plant and job commitments.  These incentives are available until December 2051.  The fair value of the land in 2022 was $144million and was recorded inNet Propertyfully offset by the value of the incentive.  A capital grant of $285million was received in 2023 and will be recognized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the related assets.\n\n\nIn 2022, we were also awarded incentives by the Canadian government and Province of Ontario in connection with the development of electric vehicles at our Oakville Assembly Plant.  Equipment, tooling, and labor incentives of C$590million are expected to be received over the terms of the agreements beginning in 2024 through 2033 and will be recognized as a reduction of the related expenses.\n\n\nFord may also indirectly benefit from incentives and grants awarded to companies with which we are affiliated but are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nFord's receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or claw back.  Claw back provisions are monitored for ongoing compliance and are accrued for when losses are deemed probable and estimable (see Note 25).\n\n\nEmployee Bonus and Lump-Sum Payments\n\n\nEffective November 20, 2023, we entered into a new agreement with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\"UAW\")covering approximately59,000employees in the United States.  The agreement established wages and benefits for covered employees over a four-and-a-half year period through April 30, 2028.  The agreement also provided for a lump-sum ratification bonus of $5,000per employee, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\nIn addition, we entered into a newthree-year agreement on September 25, 2023 with Uniforcovering approximately5,600employees in Canada.  The agreement included a Productivity and Quality bonus of C$10,000for full-time employees and C$4,000for temporary part-time employees upon signing of the contract.\n\n\nLump-sum cash bonuses paid in connection with ratifying a union contract are recognized in the period that the contract negotiations are finalized and approved by its members.We recorded approximately $400million inCost of salesrelated to these bonuses for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\nSelected Other Costs\n\n\nEngineering, research, and development expenses are primarily reported inCost of salesand consist of salaries, materials, and associated costs.  Engineering, research, and development costs are expensed as incurred when performed internally or when performed by a supplier if we guarantee reimbursement.Advertising costs are reported inSelling, administrative, and other expensesand are expensed as incurred.Engineering, research, development, and advertising expenses for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in billions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nEngineering, research, and development\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n8.2\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n119\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 3.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\n\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\n\n\nAccounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2022-02, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the new standard, which eliminates the troubled debt recognition and measurement guidance and requires disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination (vintage disclosure).  Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.\n\n\nASU 2022-04, Liabilities \u2013 Supplier Finance Programs, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the new standard, which requires that entities that use supplier finance programs disclose information about the nature and potential magnitude of the programs, activity during the period, and changes from period to period.\n\n\nFinancial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (\"SCF\") program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide.  Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity.  We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it.The outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions, reported inPayables, was $253million and $220million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The amount settled through the SCF program during 2023 was $1.8billion.\n\n\nWe also adopted the following ASUs during 2023, none of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures:\n\n\nASU\n\n\nEffective Date\n\n\n2022-01\n\n\nDerivatives and Hedging\u2013Fair Value Hedging\u2013Portfolio Layer Hedging\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\n\n2022-03\n\n\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\n\n2018-12\n\n\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long Duration Contracts (and related amendments)\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\n\n2023-03\n\n\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Bulletins & Announcements\n\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\n\n2023-04\n\n\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121\n\n\nAugust 3, 2023\n\n\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\n\n\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.In November 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and provides more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application required.  We are assessing the effect on our annual consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or income statements.\n\n\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.  In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted.  We are assessing the effect on our annual consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or income statements.\n\n\nAll other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.\n\n\n120\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 4.REVENUE\n\n\nThe following tables disaggregate our revenue by major source for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\nConsolidated\n\n\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n120,973\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n120,973\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n2,358\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,358\n\n\nServices and other revenue (a)\n\n\n2,651\n\n\n161\n\n\n2,812\n\n\nRevenues from sales and services\n\n\n125,982\n\n\n161\n\n\n126,143\n\n\nLeasing income\n\n\n286\n\n\n5,291\n\n\n5,577\n\n\nFinancing income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,560\n\n\n4,560\n\n\nInsurance income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n61\n\n\n61\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n126,268\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,073\n\n\n$\n\n\n136,341\n\n\n2022\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\nConsolidated\n\n\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n144,471\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n144,471\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n1,719\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1,719\n\n\nServices and other revenue (a)\n\n\n2,688\n\n\n100\n\n\n2,788\n\n\nRevenues from sales and services\n\n\n148,878\n\n\n100\n\n\n148,978\n\n\nLeasing income\n\n\n201\n\n\n4,569\n\n\n4,770\n\n\nFinancing income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,254\n\n\n4,254\n\n\nInsurance income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n55\n\n\n55\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n149,079\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,978\n\n\n$\n\n\n158,057\n\n\n2023\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nFord Credit\n\n\nConsolidated\n\n\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n161,052\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n161,052\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n1,873\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1,873\n\n\nServices and other revenue (a)\n\n\n2,797\n\n\n105\n\n\n2,902\n\n\nRevenues from sales and services\n\n\n165,722\n\n\n105\n\n\n165,827\n\n\nLeasing income\n\n\n179\n\n\n4,105\n\n\n4,284\n\n\nFinancing income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n5,980\n\n\n5,980\n\n\nInsurance income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n100\n\n\n100\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n165,901\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,290\n\n\n$\n\n\n176,191\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes extended service contract revenue.\n\n\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs when we transfer control of our vehicles, parts, or accessories, or provide services.Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity.  Sales, value-added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense.  The expected costs associated with our base warranties and field service actions are recognized as expense when the products are sold (see Note 25).  We do not have any material significant payment terms as payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale.\n\n\n121\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 4.  REVENUE(Continued)\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nVehicles, Parts, and Accessories.For the majority of vehicles, parts, and accessories, we transfer control and recognize a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer (dealers and distributors).  We receive cash equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales at the time of wholesale.  When the vehicle sale is financed by our wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Credit, the dealer is obligated to pay Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to the retail customer (see Note 10).  Payment terms on part sales to dealers, distributors, and retailers range from30to120days.  The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies with changes in return rights and marketing incentives we offer to our customers and their customers.  When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts and accessories, we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience.  Estimates of marketing incentives are based on expected retail and fleet sales volumes, mix of products to be sold, and incentive programs to be offered.  Customer acceptance of products and programs, as well as other market conditions, will impact these estimates.  We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed.As a result of changes in our estimate of marketing incentives, we recorded an increase in revenue of $252million and $209million during 2021 and 2022, respectively, and a decrease in revenue of $147million during 2023 related to revenue recognized in prior annual periods.\n\n\nWe have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories has transferred to the customer as an expense inCost of sales.\n\n\nWe sell vehicles to daily rental companies and may guarantee that we will pay them the difference between an agreed amount and the value they are able to realize upon resale.  At the time of transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies, we record the probable amount we will pay under the guarantee toOther liabilities and deferred revenue(see Note 25).\n\n\nUsed Vehicles.We sell used vehicles both at auction and through our consolidated dealerships.  Proceeds from the sale of these vehicles are recognized inCompany excluding Ford Credit revenuesupon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer, and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized inCost of sales.\n\n\nServices and other revenue.For separate or stand-ready performance obligations that are included as part of the vehicle consideration received (e.g., free extended service contracts, vehicle connectivity, over-the-air updates), we use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price or, when one is not available, we use a cost-plus margin approach.  We also sell separately priced service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranty agreements to vehicle owners.  We receive payment at contract inception and the contracts generally range from12to120months.  We recognize revenue for vehicle service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranties over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations.  Revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed.\n\n\nWe had a balance of $4.3billion and $4.4billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts reported inOther liabilities and deferred revenueat December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.  We recognized$1.4billion and $1.5billion of the unearned amounts as revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  At December 31, 2023, the unearned amount was $4.8billion.  We expect to recognize approximately $1.5billion of the unearned amount in 2024, $1.2billion in 2025, and $2.1billion thereafter.\n\n\nWe record a premium deficiency reserve to the extent we estimate the future costs associated with extended service contracts exceed the unrecognized revenue.  Amounts paid to dealers to obtain these contracts are deferred and recorded asOther assets.  These costs are amortized to expense consistent with how the related revenue is recognized.We had a balance of $315million and $317million in deferred costs as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  We recognized $81million, $88million, and $103million of amortization during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n122\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 4.  REVENUE(Continued)\n\n\nWe also receive other revenue related to vehicle-related design and testing services we perform for others, various Ford Next operations, and net commissions for serving as the agent in facilitating the sale of a third party's products or services to our customers.  We have applied the practical expedient to recognizeCompany excluding Ford Credit revenuesfor vehicle-related design and testing services over thetwotothreeyear term of these agreements in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice.\n\n\nLeasing Income.We sell vehicles to daily rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer.  The transactions are accounted for as operating leases.  Upon the transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies, we record proceeds received inOther liabilities and deferred revenue.The difference between the proceeds received and the agreed upon repurchase amount is recorded inCompany excluding Ford Credit revenuesover the term of the lease using a straight-line method.  The cost of the vehicle is recorded inNet investment in operating leaseson our consolidated balance sheets and the difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value is depreciated inCost of salesover the term of the lease.\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nLeasing Income.Ford Credit offers leasing plans to retail consumers through Ford and Lincoln brand dealers that originate the leases.  Ford Credit records an operating lease upon purchase of a vehicle subject to a lease from the dealer.  The retail consumer makes lease payments representing the difference between Ford Credit's purchase price of the vehicle and the contractual residual value of the vehicle plus lease fees, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.  Depreciation and the gain or loss upon disposition of the vehicle is recorded inFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses.\n\n\nFinancing Income.Ford Credit originates and purchases finance installment contracts.  Financing income represents interest earned on the finance receivables (including sales-type and direct financing leases).  Interest is recognized using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain direct origination costs.\n\n\nInsurance Income.Income from insurance contracts is recognized evenly over the term of the agreement.  Insurance commission revenue is recognized on a net basis at the time of sale of the third party's product or service to our customer.\n\n\nNOTE 5.OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)\n\n\nThe amounts included inOther income/(loss), netfor the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nNet periodic pension and OPEB income/(cost), excluding service cost (Note 17)\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,997\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,336\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,494)\n\n\nInvestment-related interest income\n\n\n254\n\n\n639\n\n\n1,567\n\n\nInterest income/(expense) on income taxes\n\n\n7\n\n\n(23)\n\n\n(16)\n\n\nRealized and unrealized gains/(losses) on cash equivalents, marketable securities, and other investments (a)\n\n\n9,159\n\n\n(7,518)\n\n\n(205)\n\n\nGains/(Losses) on changes in investments in affiliates (Note 21 and Note 22)\n\n\n368\n\n\n(147)\n\n\n9\n\n\nGains/(Losses) on extinguishment of debt (Note 19)\n\n\n(1,702)\n\n\n(121)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nRoyalty income\n\n\n619\n\n\n483\n\n\n477\n\n\nOther\n\n\n31\n\n\n201\n\n\n59\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,733\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,150)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(603)\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Includes a $9.1billion gain, $7.4billion loss, and $31million loss on our Rivian investment during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n123\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 6.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n\nUnder our Long-Term Incentive Plans, we may issue restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), restricted stock shares (\"RSSs\"), and stock options.  RSUs and RSSs consist of time-based and performance-based awards.  The number of shares that may be granted in any year is limited to2% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 31 of the prior calendar year.  The limit may be increased up to3% in any year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years.  Granted RSUs generally cliff vest or ratably vest over athree-yearservice period.  Performance-based RSUs can be based on internal financial performance metrics or total shareholder return relative to a peer group or a combination of the two metrics.  At the time of vest, RSU awards are net settled (i.e., shares are withheld to cover the employee tax obligation).  Stock options ratably vest over athree-yearservice period and expireten yearsfrom the grant date.\n\n\nThe fair value of both the time-based and the internal performance metrics portion of the performance-based RSUs and RSSs is determined using the closing price of our Common Stock at grant date.  For awards that include a market condition, we measure the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation.The weighted average per unit grant date fair value for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023 was $13.02, $15.63, and $12.98, respectively.\n\n\nTime-based RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby one-third of each grant vests after the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third after the second anniversary, and one-third after the third anniversary.  The graded vesting method recognizes expense over the service period for each separately-vesting tranche, which results in accelerated recognition of expense.  The fair value of time-based RSUs, RSSs, and stock options is expensed over the shorter of each separate vesting period, using the graded vesting method, or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.  The fair value of performance-based RSUs and RSSs is expensed when it is probable and estimable as measured against the performance metrics over the shorter of the performance or required service periods.  We measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (for options without a market condition) or a Monte Carlo simulation (for options with a market condition).

INCOME TAXES(Continued)\n\n\nOur accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\n\n\nComponents of Income Taxes\n\n\nComponents of income taxes excluding cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, other comprehensive income/(loss), and equity in net results of affiliated companies accounted for after-tax for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes (in millions)\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,043\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6,548)\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,395\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n7,737\n\n\n3,532\n\n\n572\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n17,780\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,016)\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,967\n\n\nProvision for/(Benefit from) income taxes (in millions)\n\n\nCurrent\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n$\n\n\n102\n\n\n$\n\n\n68\n\n\n$\n\n\n62\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n598\n\n\n781\n\n\n948\n\n\nState and local\n\n\n26\n\n\n123\n\n\n229\n\n\nTotal current\n\n\n726\n\n\n972\n\n\n1,239\n\n\nDeferred\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n2,290\n\n\n(2,292)\n\n\n(413)\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n(3,254)\n\n\n688\n\n\n(1,149)\n\n\nState and local\n\n\n108\n\n\n(232)\n\n\n(39)\n\n\nTotal deferred\n\n\n(856)\n\n\n(1,836)\n\n\n(1,601)\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n(130)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(864)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(362)\n\n\nReconciliation of effective tax rate\n\n\nU.S. statutory tax rate\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nNon-U.S. tax rate differential\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n(8.7)\n\n\n(3.4)\n\n\nState and local income taxes\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\nGeneral business credits\n\n\n(2.3)\n\n\n13.0\n\n\n(15.9)\n\n\nNontaxable foreign currency gains and losses\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(4.2)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nDispositions and restructurings (a)\n\n\n(18.8)\n\n\n(7.0)\n\n\n(14.7)\n\n\nU.S. tax on non-U.S. earnings\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n7.7\n\n\nPrior year settlements and claims\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nTax incentives\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n(3.9)\n\n\nEnacted change in tax laws\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nValuation allowances\n\n\n(4.7)\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n(2.4)\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n%\n\n\n28.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n(9.1)\n\n\n%\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)2021 includes a benefit of $2.9billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure; 2023 includes benefits of $610million associated with legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China.\n\n\nIn 2021, we reversed $918million of previously established U.S. valuation allowances.

The receivables are generally secured by the vehicles, inventory, or other property being financed.\n\n\nConsumer Portfolio.Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of Ford and Lincoln vehicles from dealers for personal or commercial use.  Retail financing includes retail installment contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases with retail customers, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.\n\n\nNon-Consumer Portfolio.Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers.  Dealer financing includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer programs.  Wholesale financing is approximately96% of dealer financing.\n\n\nFinance receivables are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.\n\n\nFor all finance receivables, Ford Credit defines \"past due\" as any payment, including principal and interest, that is at least31days past the contractual due date.\n\n\nFinance Receivables Classification\n\n\nFinance receivables are accounted for as held for investment (\"HFI\") if Ford Credit has the intent and ability to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.  The determination of intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future is highly judgmental and requires Ford Credit to make good faith estimates based on all information available at the time of origination or purchase.If Ford Credit does not have the intent and ability to hold the receivables, then the receivables are classified as HFS.\n\n\nEach quarter, Ford Credit makes a determination of whether it is probable that finance receivables originated or purchased during the quarter will be held for the foreseeable future based on historical receivables sale experience, internal forecasts and budgets, as well as other relevant, reliable information available through the date of evaluation.  For purposes of this determination, probable means at least70% likely and, consistent with the budgeting and forecasting period, the foreseeable future means twelve months.  Ford Credit classifies receivables as HFI or HFS on a receivable-by-receivable basis.  Specific receivables included in off-balance sheet sale transactions are generally not identified until the month in which the sale occurs.\n\n\nHeld-for-Investment.Finance receivables classified as HFI are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.  Cash flows from finance receivables, excluding wholesale and other receivables, that were originally classified as HFI are recorded as an investing activity since GAAP requires the statement of cash flows presentation to be based on the original classification of the receivables.  Cash flows from wholesale and other receivables are recorded as an operating activity.\n\n\nHeld-for-Sale.Finance receivables classified as HFS are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  Cash flows resulting from the origination or purchase and sale of HFS receivables are recorded as an operating activity inDecrease/(Increase) in finance receivables (wholesale and other).  Once a decision has been made to sell receivables that were originally classified as HFI, the receivables are reclassified as HFS and carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  The valuation adjustment, if applicable, is recorded inOther income/(loss), netto recognize the receivables at the lower of cost or fair value.\n\n\n133\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.

The receivables are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations or the claims of Ford Credit's other creditors.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions (see Note 24).\n\n\nCredit Quality\n\n\nConsumer Portfolio\n\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, Ford Credit uses a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality using information in the credit application, proposed contract terms, credit bureau data, and other information.  After a proprietary risk score is generated, Ford Credit decides whether to purchase a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information.  The evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations.\n\n\nAfter origination, Ford Credit reviews the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity.  As each customer develops a payment history, an internally developed behavioral scoring model is used to assist in determining the best collection strategies, which allows Ford Credit to focus collection activity on higher-risk accounts.  These models are used to refine Ford Credit's risk-based staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk.  Based on data from this scoring model, contracts are categorized by collection risk.  Ford Credit's collection models evaluate several factors, including origination characteristics, updated credit bureau data, and payment patterns.\n\n\nCredit quality ratings for consumer receivables are based on aging.  Consumer receivables credit quality ratings are as follows:\n\n\n\u2022Pass\u2013 current to60days past due;\n\n\n\u2022Special Mention\u201361to120days past due and in intensified collection status; and\n\n\n\u2022Substandard\u2013 greater than120days past due and for which the uncollectible portion of the receivables has already been charged off, as measured using the fair value of collateral less costs to sell.\n\n\n135\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.

Payment is typically required when the dealer has sold the vehicle.  Each non-consumer lending request is evaluated by considering the borrower's financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan.  Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating.  This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealer's ability to meet its financial obligations.  Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer's operations, including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors.\n\n\nDealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows:\n\n\n\u2022Group I\u2013 strong to superior financial metrics;\n\n\n\u2022Group II\u2013 fair to favorable financial metrics;\n\n\n\u2022Group III\u2013 marginal to weak financial metrics; and\n\n\n\u2022Group IV\u2013 poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.\n\n\nFord Credit generally suspends credit lines and extends no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV.\n\n\n136\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES(Continued)\n\n\nFord Credit regularly reviews the model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the model and may make updates to improve the performance of the model.  In addition, Ford Credit regularly audits dealer inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle.  The frequency of on-site vehicle inventory audits depends primarily on the dealer's risk rating.  Under Ford Credit's policies, on-site vehicle inventory audits of low-risk dealers are conducted only as circumstances warrant.  On-site vehicle inventory audits of higher-risk dealers are conducted with increased frequency based primarily on the dealer's risk rating, but also considering the results of electronic monitoring of the dealer's performance, including daily payment verifications and monthly analyses of the dealer's financial statements, payoffs, aged inventory, over credit line, and delinquency reports.  Ford Credit typically performs a credit review of each dealer annually and more frequently reviews certain dealers based on the dealer's risk rating and total exposure.  Ford Credit adjusts the dealer's risk rating, if necessary.  The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on Ford Credit's internal dealer risk rating analysis.  A dealer has the same risk rating for its entire dealer financing regardless of the type of financing.\n\n\nThe credit quality analysis of dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2022 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\n\n\nWholesale Loans\n\n\nDealer Loans\n\n\nPrior to 2018\n\n\n2018\n\n\n2019\n\n\n2020\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nPercent\n\n\nGroup I\n\n\n$\n\n\n402\n\n\n$\n\n\n148\n\n\n$\n\n\n35\n\n\n$\n\n\n67\n\n\n$\n\n\n185\n\n\n$\n\n\n224\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,061\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,888\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,949\n\n\n82.8\n\n\n%\n\n\nGroup II\n\n\n2\n\n\n21\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n42\n\n\n72\n\n\n2,751\n\n\n2,823\n\n\n15.6\n\n\nGroup III\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n233\n\n\n243\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nGroup IV\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n35\n\n\n39\n\n\n0.2\n\n\nTotal (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n404\n\n\n$\n\n\n169\n\n\n$\n\n\n36\n\n\n$\n\n\n72\n\n\n$\n\n\n187\n\n\n$\n\n\n279\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,147\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,907\n\n\n$\n\n\n18,054\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%__________\n\n\n(a)Total past due dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2022 were $9million.\n\n\nThe credit quality analysis of dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2023 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\n\n\nWholesale Loans\n\n\nDealer Loans\n\n\nPrior to 2019\n\n\n2019\n\n\n2020\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nPercent\n\n\nGroup I\n\n\n$\n\n\n383\n\n\n$\n\n\n30\n\n\n$\n\n\n58\n\n\n$\n\n\n156\n\n\n$\n\n\n61\n\n\n$\n\n\n331\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,019\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,419\n\n\n$\n\n\n21,438\n\n\n86.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nGroup II\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n44\n\n\n66\n\n\n2,834\n\n\n2,900\n\n\n11.7\n\n\nGroup III\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n292\n\n\n301\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nGroup IV\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n41\n\n\n44\n\n\n0.2\n\n\nTotal (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n399\n\n\n$\n\n\n31\n\n\n$\n\n\n59\n\n\n$\n\n\n159\n\n\n$\n\n\n64\n\n\n$\n\n\n385\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,097\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,586\n\n\n$\n\n\n24,683\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nGross charge-offs\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n1\n\n\n$\n\n\n1\n\n\n$\n\n\n3\n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Total past due dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2023 were $33million.\n\n\nNon-Accrual of Revenue.The accrual of financing revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible or when it is90days past due.  Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured.  For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received.  Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance.\n\n\nLoan Modifications.Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate and/or a term extension (including receivables that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are typically considered to be loan modifications.  Ford Credit does not grant modifications to the principal balance of the receivables.  If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.\n\n\n137\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES(Continued)\n\n\nThe use of interest rate modifications and term extensions helps Ford Credit mitigate financial loss.  Term extensions may assist in cases where Ford Credit believes the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments.  The effect of most loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in the historical trends used to measure the allowance for credit losses.  A loan modification that improves the delinquency status of a borrower reduces the probability of default, which results in a lower allowance for credit losses.  At December 31, 2023, an insignificant portion of Ford Credit's total finance receivables portfolio had been granted a loan modification, and these modifications are generally treated as a continuation of the existing loan.\n\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly.\n\n\nAdjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges toFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenseson our consolidated income statements.  The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is120days delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors, and other factors.\n\n\nCharge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other allowable charges.  Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses.  In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported inOther assetson our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nConsumer Portfolio\n\n\nFor consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics such as product type, initial credit risk, term, vintage, geography, and other relevant factors, Ford Credit estimates the lifetime expected credit loss allowance based on a collective assessmentusing measurement models and management judgment.  The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumption to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable's original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.  Probability of default models are developed from internal risk scoring models taking into account the expected probability of payment and time to default, adjusted for macroeconomic outlook and recent performance.  The models consider factors such as risk evaluation at the time of origination, historical trends in credit losses, and the composition and recent performance of the present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles).  The loss given default is the percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable, taking into account the expected collateral value and trends in recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies).  Monthly exposures are equal to the receivables' expected outstanding principal and interest balance.\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates forward-looking macroeconomic conditions for baseline, upturn, and downturn scenarios.  Three separate credit loss allowances are calculated from these scenarios.  They are then probability-weighted to determine the quantitative estimate of the credit loss allowance recognized in the financial statements.  Ford Credit uses forecasts from a third party that revert to a long-term historical average after a reasonable and supportable forecasting period, which is specific to the particular macroeconomic variable and which varies by market.  Ford Credit updates the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts quarterly.\n\n\nIf management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\n\n\nOn an ongoing basis, Ford Credit reviews its models, including macroeconomic factors, the selection of macroeconomic scenarios, and their weighting, to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio.\n\n\n138\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES(Continued)\n\n\nNon-Consumer Portfolio\n\n\nDealer financing is evaluated on an individual dealer basis by segmenting dealers by risk characteristics (such as the amount of the loans, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the dealer) to determine if an individual dealer requires a specific allowance for credit loss.  If required, the allowance is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the dealer's receivables discounted at the loans' original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.\n\n\nFor the remaining dealer financing, Ford Credit estimates an allowance for credit losses on a collective basis.\n\n\nWholesale Loans.Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans based on historical loss-to-receivable (\"LTR\") ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral.  For wholesale loans with similar risk characteristics, the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a collective basis using the LTR model and management judgment.  The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history.  An LTR ratio is calculated by dividing credit losses (i.e., charge-offs net of recoveries) by average net finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses.  The average LTR ratio is multiplied by the end-of-period balances, representing the lifetime expected credit loss reserve.\n\n\nDealer Loans.Ford Credit uses a weighted-average remaining maturity method to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss reserve for dealer loans.  The loss model is based on the industry-wide commercial real estate credit losses, adjusted to factor in the historical credit losses for the dealer loans portfolio.  The expected credit loss is calculated under different macroeconomic scenarios that are weighted to provide the total lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n\nAfter establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant forward-looking economic factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.\n\n\n139\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 10.

Estimated residual values are based on assumptions for used vehicle prices at lease termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to be returned.  Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.\n\n\nThe net investment in operating leases at December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nCompany excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nVehicles, net of depreciation\n\n\n$\n\n\n951\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,052\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nVehicles, at cost (a)\n\n\n26,055\n\n\n24,182\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n\n\n(4,234)\n\n\n(3,850)\n\n\nTotal Ford Credit Segment\n\n\n21,821\n\n\n20,332\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,772\n\n\n$\n\n\n21,384\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes Ford Credit's operating lease assets of $12.5billion and $11.2billion at December 31, 2022and2023, respectively, that have been included in securitization transactions.

We determined that Argo AI no longer had value as a going concern, and as a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment as of September 30, 2022.  Our valuation assumed an orderly conclusion of operations at Argo AI, in which the cash required to satisfy the remaining obligations would consume all of Argo AI's remaining capital.  In addition, we assessed whether Argo AI's technology components had value in isolation, and we concluded that the cost to integrate into anticipated technology ecosystems would be prohibitive.  Accordingly, we recorded a $2.7billion pre-tax impairment in the third quarter of 2022.  The non-cash charge was reported inEquity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies.\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Ford and Volkswagen AG, who held equal interests that together comprised a majority ownership of Argo AI, initiated the process of exiting the joint development of highly automated driving technology (L4) through Argo AI.  Argo AI is in the process of winding down operations, with no expected future funding required.\n\n\n144\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 15.OTHER INVESTMENTS\n\n\nWe have investments in entities not accounted for under the equity method for which fair values are not readily available.

The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the provisions of each specific plan, demographics of the group covered by the plan, and other key measurement assumptions.  For plans that provide benefits dependent on salary assumptions, we include a projection of salary growth in our measurements.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).\n\n\nNet periodic benefit costs, including service cost, interest cost, and expected return on assets, are determined using assumptions regarding the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets (where applicable) as of the beginning of each year.  We have elected to use a fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost.  The funded status of the benefit plans, which represents the difference between the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis.  The benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using assumptions as of the end of each year.  Actuarial gains and losses resulting from plan remeasurement are recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the period of the remeasurement.  The impact of a retroactive plan amendment is recorded inAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss),and is amortized as a component of net periodic cost, generally over the remaining service period of the active employees.  The service cost component is included inCost of salesandSelling, administrative and other expenses.  Other components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) are included inOther income/(loss), neton our consolidated income statements.\n\n\nA curtailment results from an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees.  A curtailment gain is recorded when the employees who are entitled to a benefit terminate their employment, or when a plan suspension or amendment that results in a curtailment gain is adopted.  A curtailment loss is recorded when it becomes probable a curtailment loss will occur.  We recognize settlement expense when the costs associated with all settlements during the year exceed the interest component of net periodic cost for the affected plan.  Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded inOther income/(loss), net.\n\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans.We have defined benefit pension plans covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and other locations.  The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans.  Virtually all of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.\n\n\nIn general, our defined benefit pension plans are funded (i.e., have restricted assets from which benefits are paid).  Our unfunded defined benefit pension plans are treated on a \"pay as you go\" basis with benefit payments from general Company cash.  These unfunded plans primarily include certain plans in Germany and the U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.\n\n\nOPEB.  We have defined benefit OPEB plans, primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits, covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States, Canada, and other locations.  The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans.  Our OPEB plans are unfunded and the benefits are paid from general Company cash.\n\n\nDefined Contribution and Savings Plans.  We also have defined contribution and savings plans for hourly and salaried employees in the United States and other locations.

We may make contributions beyond those legally required.\n\n\nIn 2023, we contributed $592million to our global funded pension plans and made $402million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  During 2024, we expect to contribute about $1billion of cash to our global funded pension plans.  We also expect to make about $400million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans in 2024.\n\n\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\n\n\nThe expected future benefit payments at December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\nBenefit Payments\n\n\nPension\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\nNon-U.S.Plans\n\n\nWorldwideOPEB\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,715\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,430\n\n\n$\n\n\n340\n\n\n2025\n\n\n2,670\n\n\n1,295\n\n\n340\n\n\n2026\n\n\n2,635\n\n\n1,310\n\n\n340\n\n\n2027\n\n\n2,600\n\n\n1,325\n\n\n330\n\n\n2028\n\n\n2,575\n\n\n1,330\n\n\n330\n\n\n2029-2033\n\n\n12,475\n\n\n6,640\n\n\n1,610\n\n\nPension Plan Asset Information\n\n\nInvestment Objectives and Strategies.  Our investment objectives for the U.S. plans are to minimize the volatility of the value of our U.S. pension assets relative to U.S. pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits.  Our largest non-U.S. plans (e.g., United Kingdom and Canada) have similar investment objectives to the U.S. plans.\n\n\nInvestment strategies and policies for the U.S. plans and the largest non-U.S. plans reflect a balance of risk-reducing and return-seeking considerations.  The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed primarily through asset-liability matching, asset diversification, and hedging.  The fixed income asset allocation matches the bond-like and long-dated nature of the pension obligations.  Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve risk-adjusted returns that, in total, lower asset volatility relative to the obligations.  Strategies to address the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes, and strategies within asset classes that provide adequate returns, diversification, and liquidity.\n\n\n149\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 17.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS(Continued)\n\n\nDerivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.  Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations.  Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration.  Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment manager has been given.  Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage (including through the use of derivatives or other tools) that may alter economic exposure.\n\n\nAlternative investments execute diverse strategies that provide exposure to a broad range of hedge fund strategies, equity investments in private companies, and investments in private property funds.\n\n\nSignificant Concentrations of Risk.Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rates, growth assets, and operating risks.  In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations, the majority of plan assets are allocated to fixed income investments which are exposed to interest rate risk.  Rate increases generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets, while reducing the present value of the obligations.  Conversely, rate decreases generally will increase the value of fixed income assets, offsetting the related increase in the obligations.\n\n\nIn order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets (primarily hedge funds, real estate, private equity, and public equity) that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more volatility than fixed income investments, which more closely match pension obligations.  Within growth assets, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class, investment strategy, manager, style, and process.\n\n\nOperating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls.  To mitigate these risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives.  Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight (e.g., style adherence, team strength, firm health, and internal risk controls), plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance reviews to ensure adherence.\n\n\nAt year-end 2023, Ford securities comprised less than1% of our plan assets.\n\n\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets.The long-term return assumption at year-end 2023, which will be used to determine the 2024 expected return on assets, is5.93% for the U.S. plans,3.84% for the U.K. plans, and5.06% for the Canadian plans, and averages4.53% for all non-U.S. plans.  A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption.  This approach considers inputs from advisors for long-term capital market returns adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we transferred a non-U.S. pension obligation and related plan assets to an insurance company.  There were no gains or losses recognized upon settlement.\n\n\nNOTE 18.LEASE COMMITMENTS\n\n\nWe lease land, dealership facilities, offices, distribution centers, warehouses, and equipment under agreements with contractual periods ranging from less thanone yearto40years.  Many of our leases contain one or more options to extend.  In certain dealership lease agreements, we are the tenant and we sublease the site to a dealer.  In the event the sublease is terminated, we have the option to terminate the head lease.  We include options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in our evaluation of the lease term after considering all relevant economic and financial factors.\n\n\nLeases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases.  The leased (\"right-of-use\") assets in finance lease arrangements are reported inNet propertyon our consolidated balance sheets.Otherwise, the leases are classified as operating leases and reported inOther assetsin the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.  We have also entered into manufacturing contracts where Ford's portion of the output is expected to be significant.  As a result, there are embedded leases, and related liabilities, that are reported as part of our financial statements, typically upon commencement of production.\n\n\nFor the majority of our leases, we do not separate the non-lease components (e.g., maintenance and operating services) from the lease components to which they relate.  Instead, non-lease components are included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.  However, we do separate lease and non-lease components for contracts containing a significant service component (e.g., energy performance contracts).  We calculate the initial lease liability as the present value of fixed payments not yet paid and variable payments that are based on a market rate or an index (e.g., CPI), measured at commencement.  The majority of our leases are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.  All other variable payments are expensed as incurred.\n\n\n153\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 18.LEASE COMMITMENTS(Continued)\n\n\nLease right-of-use assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\nOther assets, non-current\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,447\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,833\n\n\nOther liabilities and deferred revenue, current\n\n\n$\n\n\n404\n\n\n$\n\n\n481\n\n\nOther liabilities and deferred revenue, non-current\n\n\n1,101\n\n\n1,395\n\n\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,505\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,876\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\nProperty and equipment, gross\n\n\n$\n\n\n791\n\n\n$\n\n\n897\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n\n\n(109)\n\n\n(114)\n\n\nProperty and equipment, net\n\n\n$\n\n\n682\n\n\n$\n\n\n783\n\n\nCompany excluding Ford Credit debt payable within one year\n\n\n$\n\n\n86\n\n\n$\n\n\n32\n\n\nCompany excluding Ford Credit long-term debt\n\n\n488\n\n\n606\n\n\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n574\n\n\n$\n\n\n638\n\n\nThe amounts contractually due on our lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\nOperating Leases (a)\n\n\nFinanceLeases\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n558\n\n\n$\n\n\n67\n\n\n2025\n\n\n457\n\n\n102\n\n\n2026\n\n\n346\n\n\n81\n\n\n2027\n\n\n264\n\n\n76\n\n\n2028\n\n\n176\n\n\n68\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n335\n\n\n498\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n2,136\n\n\n892\n\n\nLess:  Present value discount\n\n\n260\n\n\n254\n\n\nTotal lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,876\n\n\n$\n\n\n638\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Excludes approximately $449million in future lease payments for various leases commencing in future periods.\n\n\n154\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 18.LEASE COMMITMENTS(Continued)\n\n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n\n\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n\n\n$\n\n\n424\n\n\n$\n\n\n459\n\n\n$\n\n\n581\n\n\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n\n\n14\n\n\n22\n\n\n32\n\n\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n\n\n52\n\n\n83\n\n\n91\n\n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\n$\n\n\n441\n\n\n$\n\n\n528\n\n\n$\n\n\n889\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\n192\n\n\n95\n\n\n165\n\n\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nOperating lease expense\n\n\n$\n\n\n444\n\n\n$\n\n\n463\n\n\n$\n\n\n580\n\n\nVariable lease expense\n\n\n49\n\n\n62\n\n\n109\n\n\nSublease income\n\n\n(16)\n\n\n(15)\n\n\n(18)\n\n\nFinance lease expense\n\n\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n\n\n34\n\n\n60\n\n\n64\n\n\nInterest on lease liabilities\n\n\n14\n\n\n22\n\n\n32\n\n\nTotal lease expense\n\n\n$\n\n\n525\n\n\n$\n\n\n592\n\n\n$\n\n\n767\n\n\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate at December 31 were as follows:\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n5.4\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\n12.1\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n11.9\n\n\nWeighted-average discount rate\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n%\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n5.3\n\n\nNOTE 19.DEBT AND COMMITMENTS\n\n\nOur debt consists of short-term and long-term secured and unsecured debt securities, and secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders.

The interest rate of this green bond was6.1%.  We allocated the net proceeds from this issuance to the design, development, and manufacturing of our electric vehicle portfolio.\n\n\nConvertible Debt\n\n\nIn March 2021, we issued $2.3billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, including $300million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment option granted to the initial purchasers.  The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete.  The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.267billion.\n\n\nEach $1,000principal amount of the notes will be convertible into65.5824shares of our Common Stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $15.25per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.  The notes are convertible, at the option of the noteholders, on or after December 15, 2025.  Prior to December 15, 2025, the notes are convertible only under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\u2022During any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of30consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to130% of the conversion price of the notes on each applicable trading day;\n\n\n\u2022During thefivebusiness day period after anyfiveconsecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000principal amount of the notes for each day of thatfiveconsecutive trading day period was less than98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such trading day;\n\n\n\u2022If we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or\n\n\n\u2022Upon the occurrence of specific corporate events such as a change in control or certain beneficial distributions to common stockholders (as set forth in the indenture governing the notes).\n\n\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election for the remainder of our obligation in excess, if any, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\n\nWe may not redeem the notes prior to March 20, 2024.  On or after March 20, 2024, we may redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash equal to100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock has been at least130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any30consecutive trading day period.\n\n\n159\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 19.  DEBT AND COMMITMENTS(Continued)\n\n\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (e.g., change of control), subject to certain conditions, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to100% of the principal amount of the notes.  In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date or if we issue a notice of redemption, we will increase the conversion rate by pre-defined amounts for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event.  The conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert were not met in 2022 or 2023.\n\n\nThe notes were issued at par and fees associated with the issuance of these notes are amortized toInterest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Creditover the contractual term of the notes.  Amortization of issuance costs was $5million, $7million, and $7million in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.  The effective interest rate of the notes is0.3%.\n\n\nThe total estimated fair value of the notes as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $2.2billion and $2.3billion, respectively.  The fair value was determined using commonly employed valuation methodologies applying observable market inputs and is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\nThe notes didnothave an impact on our full year 2022 or 2023 diluted EPS.\n\n\nU.K. Export Finance Program\n\n\nIn 2020 and 2022, Ford Motor Company Limited (\"Ford of Britain\"), our operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom, entered into, and drew in full, \u00a3625million and \u00a3750million term loan credit facilities, respectively, with a syndicate of banks to support Ford of Britain's general export activities.  Accordingly, U.K. Export Finance (\"UKEF\") provided \u00a3500million and \u00a3600million guarantees of the credit facilities, respectively, under its Export Development Guarantee scheme, which supports high value commercial lending to U.K. exporters.  We have also guaranteed Ford of Britain's obligations under the credit facilities to the lenders.  As of December 31, 2023, the full \u00a31,375million under the two credit facilities remained outstanding.

DEBT AND COMMITMENTS(Continued)\n\n\nThe corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO2tailpipe emissions.  Ford outperformed the 2022 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which favorably impacted pricing beginning in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\nThe corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment.  The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility.  The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility.  Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.\n\n\nEach of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody's, and S&P.  On October 30, 2023, following the upgrade by S&P of our senior, unsecured, long-term debt credit rating to BBB-, the unsecured guarantees provided by the following subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facilities were released:  Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc.\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nDebt Extinguishment\n\n\nPursuant to Ford Credit's June 2022 cash tender offer, Ford Credit repurchased approximately $3billion principal amount of its public unsecured debt securities for an aggregate cost of approximately $3billion (including transaction costs and accrued and unpaid interest payments for such tendered securities).  As a result of these transactions, Ford Credit recorded a pre-tax gain of $17million (net of unamortized discounts, premiums, fees, and fair value adjustments) inOther income/(loss), netin 2022.\n\n\nAsset-Backed Debt\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $58.0billion.  This secured debt is issued by Ford Credit and includes asset-backed securities used to fund operations and maintain liquidity.  Assets securing the related debt issued as part of all our securitization transactions are included in our consolidated results and are based upon the legal transfer of the underlying assets in order to reflect legal ownership and the beneficial ownership of the debt holder.  The third-party investors in the securitization transactions have legal recourse only to the assets securing the debt and do not have such recourse to us, except for the customary representation and warranty provisions or when we are counterparty to certain derivative transactions of the special purpose entities (\"SPEs\").  In addition, the cash flows generated by the assets are restricted only to pay such liabilities; Ford Credit retains the right to residual cash flows.  See Note 24 for additional information.\n\n\nAlthough not contractually required, we regularly support our wholesale securitization programs by repurchasing receivables of a dealer from a SPE when the dealer's performance is at risk, which transfers the corresponding risk of loss from the SPE to us.  In order to continue to fund the wholesale receivables, we also may contribute additional cash or wholesale receivables if the collateral falls below required levels.  The balance of cash related to these contributions was $0at both December 31, 2022 and 2023 and ranged from $0to $2,850million during 2022 and from $0to $41million during 2023.\n\n\n161\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 19.  DEBT AND COMMITMENTS(Continued)\n\n\nSPEs that are exposed to interest rate or currency risk may reduce their risks by entering into derivative transactions. In certain instances, we have entered into derivative transactions with the counterparty to protect the counterparty from risks absorbed through derivative transactions with the SPEs.  Derivative income/(expense) related to the derivative transactions that support Ford Credit's securitization programs were $41million, $466million, and $39million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.  See Note 20 for additional information regarding the accounting for derivatives.\n\n\nInterest expense on securitization debt was $0.9billion, $1.3billion, and $2.5billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nThe assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated financial statements at December 31 were as follows (in billions):\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nAssets\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n2.7\n\n\nFinance receivables, net\n\n\n61.6\n\n\n66.8\n\n\nNet investment in operating leases\n\n\n12.5\n\n\n11.2\n\n\nLiabilities\n\n\nDebt (a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n56.4\n\n\n$\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Debt is net of unamortized discount and issuance costs.\n\n\nCommitted Credit Facilities\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Ford Credit's committed capacity totaled $45.3billion, compared with $39.7billion at December 31, 2022.

To manage these risks, we enter into highly effective derivative contracts:\n\n\n\u2022Foreign currency exchange contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage foreign exchange exposure;\n\n\n\u2022Commodity contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage commodity price risk;\n\n\n\u2022Interest rate contracts, including swaps, that are used to manage the effects of interest rate fluctuations; and\n\n\n\u2022Cross-currency interest rate swap contracts that are used to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures on foreign-denominated debt.\n\n\nOur derivatives are over-the-counter customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded.  We review our hedging program, derivative positions, and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis.\n\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting.Derivative assets are reported inOther assetsand derivative liabilities are reported inPayablesandOther liabilities and deferred revenue.\n\n\nWe have elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives.  Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at the time they are designated and throughout the hedge period.  Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\n\n\nCash Flow Hedges.We have designated certain forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions with exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks.\n\n\nChanges in the fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred inAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)and are recognized inCost of saleswhen the hedged item affects earnings.  Our policy is to de-designate foreign currency exchange cash flow hedges prior to the time forecasted transactions are recognized as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and report subsequent changes in fair value throughCost of sales.  If it becomes probable that the originally forecasted transaction will not occur, the related amount included inAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)is reclassified and recognized in earnings.  The cash flows associated with hedges designated until maturity are reported inNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activitieson our consolidated statement of cash flows.  Our cash flow hedges mature withinthree years.\n\n\nFair Value Hedges.Our Ford Credit segment uses derivatives to reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of debt.  We have designated certain receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt.  The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate and foreign exchange.  We report the change in fair value of the hedged debt related to the change in benchmark interest rate inFord Credit debtandFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses.We report the change in fair value of the hedged debt and hedging instrument related to foreign currency inOther income/(loss), net.Net interest settlements and accruals and fair value changes on hedging instruments due to the benchmark interest rate change are reported inFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses.  The cash flows associated with fair value hedges are reported inNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activitieson our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n\nWhen a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated before maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized inFord Credit interest, operating, and other expensesover its remaining life.\n\n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments.For total Company excluding Ford Credit, we report changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments throughCost of sales.  Cash flows associated with non-designated or de-designated derivatives are reported inNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activitieson our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n\nOur Ford Credit segment reports the gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments inOther income/(loss), net.

We record costs associated with involuntary separation programs when management has approved the plan for separation, the affected employees are identified, and it is unlikely that actions required to complete the separation plan will change significantly.  Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nEmployee separation actions and exit and disposal activities include employee separation costs, facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., impairment, accelerated depreciation), dealer and supplier payments, other statutory and contractual obligations, and other expenses, which are recorded inCost of salesandSelling, administrative, and other expenses.  Below are actions we have initiated:\n\n\n\u2022Brazil.Exited manufacturing operations in 2021 resulting in the closure of facilities in Cama\u00e7ari, Taubat\u00e9, and Troller.

In addition, we recognized a $38million pre-tax net gain on sale of assets in 2022.  In 2023, we recorded $67million for accelerated depreciation and other non-cash items and recognized a $62million pre-tax net gain on sale of assets.\n\n\nWe recorded charges of $608million and $1.9billion in 2022 and 2023, respectively, related to the actions above.  We estimate that we will incur about $1billion in total charges in 2024 related to such actions, primarily attributable to employee separations; some charges are related to plans that are subject to negotiations with a works council, union, or other social partner.  In addition, we continue to review our global businesses and may take additional restructuring actions where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible when considering the capital allocation required for those businesses.\n\n\n166\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 21.

In 2022, we reclassified losses of $155million toOther income/(loss),netupon the liquidation of three investments in Brazil.\n\n\nNOTE 22.ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\n\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\n\n\nAuto Motive Power (\"AMP\").On November 1, 2023, we acquired AMP, a California-based energy management startup focused on electric vehicle charging solutions.  Assets acquired primarily include goodwill and technology, which are reported inOther assets.  The acquisition did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n\nSanand, India (\"Sanand\") Plants.In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (\"Tata\"), a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited.  The sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for the plants.  We recognized, inCost of sales, pre-tax impairment charges of $32million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value less costs to sell.  We determined fair value using the market approach, based on the negotiated value of the assets.  Accordingly, we reported $88million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31, 2022, which we report inOther assetsin the current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nOn January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata.  Ford continues to operate the powertrain facility by leasing back the associated land and building.  As a result of the sale transaction, we derecognized the fixed assets and recognized the powertrain facility operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability in the first quarter of 2023.  The fair value of the cash consideration received approximated the carrying value of the fixed assets at the time of sale.\n\n\nFord Romania S.R.L. (\"Ford Romania\").On July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of Ford Romania, our wholly-owned Romanian manufacturing subsidiary, to Ford Otosan, a joint venture in which Ford has a41% ownership share.  The transaction resulted in deconsolidation of our Ford Romania subsidiary in the third quarter of 2022.  The fair value of consideration received, consisting of cash and a note receivable, approximated the carrying value of Ford Romania at the time of sale.  The Ford Romania plant in Craiova, Romania continues to manufacture Ford-branded vehicles for Ford and Ford Otosan.  Ford's portion of the output is expected to be significant; as a result, at the time of sale there were about $100million of assets, such as embedded leases, and related liabilities that continue to be reported as part of our financial statements.\n\n\nSkinny Labs Inc., dba Spin (\"Spin\").On April 1, 2022, we completed the sale of Spin, our wholly-owned micro-mobility provider, to TIER Mobility SE, a German-based micro-mobility provider, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our Spin subsidiary in the second quarter of 2022.  In exchange for our shares of Spin, we received preferred equity in TIER Mobility SE.\n\n\nElectriphi, Inc. (\"Electriphi\").On June 18, 2021, we acquired Electriphi, a California-based provider of charging management and fleet monitoring software for electric vehicles.  Assets acquired primarily include goodwill, reported inOther assets, and software, reported inNet property.

FLH will continue to import, manufacture, and sell Ford-branded vehicles through at least 2025.  We recognized a pre-tax gain of $161million, which was reported inOther income/(loss),netin the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\nGetrag Ford Transmissions GmbH (\"GFT\").Prior to March 2021, Ford and Magna International Inc. (\"Magna\") equally owned and operated the GFT joint venture for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, and selling transmissions.  We accounted for our investment in GFT as an equity method investment.  During the first quarter of 2021 and prior to our acquisition, GFT recorded restructuring charges, of which our share was $40million.  These charges are included inEquity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies.\n\n\nOn March 1, 2021, we acquired Magna's shares in the restructured GFT.  The purchase price, which was subject to post-closing revisions, was $275million.  The restructured GFT includes the Halewood, UK and Cologne, Germany transmission plants, but excludes the Bordeaux, France transmission plant and China interests acquired by Magna.  We concluded with Magna that these businesses would be better served under separate ownership.  The Sanand, India transmission plant continues under joint Ford/Magna ownership.  As a result of the transaction, we consolidated the restructured GFT, remeasured our prior investment in GFT at its $275million fair value, and recognized in Other income/(loss), neta pre-tax gain of $178million during 2021 and post-closing revisions resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2million during the first quarter of 2022.  We estimated the fair value of GFT in negotiations with Magna based on the income approach.  The significant assumptions used in the valuation included GFT's cash flows that reflect the approved business plan, discounted at a rate typically used for a company like GFT.\n\n\n168\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 23.ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)\n\n\nThe changes in the balances for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Ford Motor Company for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nForeign currency translation\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,526)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,487)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6,416)\n\n\nGains/(Losses) on foreign currency translation\n\n\n200\n\n\n(1,199)\n\n\n967\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit) (a)\n\n\n143\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(10)\n\n\nNet gains/(losses) on foreign currency translation\n\n\n57\n\n\n(1,197)\n\n\n977\n\n\n(Gains)/Losses reclassified from AOCI to net income (b)\n\n\n(18)\n\n\n268\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax (c)\n\n\n39\n\n\n(929)\n\n\n973\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,487)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6,416)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,443)\n\n\nMarketable securities\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n156\n\n\n$\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(442)\n\n\nGains/(Losses) on available for sale securities\n\n\n(209)\n\n\n(576)\n\n\n326\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n(52)\n\n\n(139)\n\n\n80\n\n\nNet gains/(losses) on available for sale securities\n\n\n(157)\n\n\n(437)\n\n\n246\n\n\n(Gains)/Losses reclassified from AOCI to net income\n\n\n(23)\n\n\n19\n\n\n35\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n5\n\n\n9\n\n\nNet (gains)/losses reclassified from AOCI to net income (b)\n\n\n(18)\n\n\n14\n\n\n26\n\n\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n\n\n(175)\n\n\n(423)\n\n\n272\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(442)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(170)\n\n\nDerivative instruments\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(266)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(193)\n\n\n$\n\n\n129\n\n\nGains/(Losses) on derivative instruments\n\n\n(169)\n\n\n346\n\n\n(519)\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n83\n\n\n(126)\n\n\nNet gains/(losses) on derivative instruments\n\n\n(149)\n\n\n263\n\n\n(393)\n\n\n(Gains)/Losses reclassified from AOCI to net income\n\n\n280\n\n\n80\n\n\n(83)\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n58\n\n\n21\n\n\n(16)\n\n\nNet (gains)/losses reclassified from AOCI to net income (d)\n\n\n222\n\n\n59\n\n\n(67)\n\n\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n\n\n73\n\n\n322\n\n\n(460)\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(193)\n\n\n$\n\n\n129\n\n\n$\n\n\n(331)\n\n\nPension and other postretirement benefits\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,658)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,640)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,610)\n\n\nPrior service (costs)/credits arising during the period (e)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(659)\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(157)\n\n\nNet prior service (costs)/credits arising during the period\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(502)\n\n\nAmortization and recognition of prior service costs/(credits) (f)\n\n\n27\n\n\n21\n\n\n25\n\n\nLess:  Tax/(Tax benefit)\n\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n\n6\n\n\nNet prior service costs/(credits) reclassified from AOCI to net income\n\n\n21\n\n\n17\n\n\n19\n\n\nTranslation impact on non-U.S. plans\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n13\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n\n\n18\n\n\n30\n\n\n(488)\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,640)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,610)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,098)\n\n\nTotal AOCI ending balance at December 31\n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,339)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(9,339)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(9,042)\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)We do not recognize deferred taxes for a majority of the foreign currency translation gains and losses because we do not anticipate reversal in the foreseeable future.

We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.  We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets.  Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs.\n\n\nWe have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key operating decisions, such as decisions regarding budgets, capital investment, manufacturing, or product development.  For securitization entities, we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the servicing of financial assets, issue additional debt, exercise a unilateral call option, add assets to revolving structures, or control investment decisions.\n\n\nVIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary\n\n\nCertain of our affiliates are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary.  Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these unconsolidated affiliates is limited to our equity investments, accounts receivable, loans, and guaranteesand was $1.0billion and $3.7billion at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  Of these amounts, guarantees of $113million and $125million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, related to certain obligations of our VIEs also are included in Note 25.\n\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On) completed the creation of BlueOval SK, LLC (\"BOSK\"), a 50/50joint venture that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates.  BOSK is a VIE of which we are not the primary beneficiary, and we use the equity method of accounting for our investment.  As of December 31, 2023, Ford has contributed to BOSK $3.3billion of its agreed capital contribution of up to $6.6billion through 2026.  The total amount of capital contributions is subject to adjustments agreed to by the parties.\n\n\nVIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary\n\n\nSecuritization Entities.Through Ford Credit, we securitize, transfer, and service financial assets associated with consumer finance receivables, operating leases, and wholesale loans.  Our securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs.  We generally retain a portion of the economic interests in the asset-backed securitization transactions, which could be retained in the form of a portion of the senior interests, the subordinated interests, cash reserve accounts, residual interests, and servicing rights.  The transfers of assets in our securitization transactions do not qualify for accounting sale treatment.  In most cases, the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the definition of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and, therefore, are consolidated.We account for all securitization transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets, liabilities, and related activity of these transactions are consolidated in our financial statements.  See Note 19 for additional information on the accounting for asset-backed debt and the assets securing this debt.\n\n\n170\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 25.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n\nCommitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications, litigation and claims, and warranty and field service actions.\n\n\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\n\n\nFinancial Guarantees.Financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception. Subsequent to initial recognition, the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee.The maximum potential payments for financial guarantees were $518million and $535million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was $31million and $59million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nOur financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth.  Expiration dates vary through 2037, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation.  A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee.  In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.\n\n\nNon-Financial Guarantees.Non-financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception.  We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity, the amount of probable payment is recorded.The maximum potential payments for non-financial guarantees were $273million and $7million at December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to non-financial guarantees was $0at both December 31, 2022 and 2023.\n\n\nIncluded in the $7million of maximum potential payments at December 31, 2023 are guarantees for the resale value of vehicles sold in certain arrangements to daily rental companies.  The maximum potential payment of $1million as of December 31, 2023 represents the total proceeds we guarantee the rental company will receive on resale.  Reflecting our present estimate of proceeds the rental companies will receive on resale from third parties, we donotexpect we will have to pay under the guarantee.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business.  These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following:  environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations.  Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty, including a joint venture or alliance partner, or a third-party claim.  While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment.  Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities.\n\n\n171\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 25.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES(Continued)\n\n\nLitigation and Claims\n\n\nVarious legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, \"matters\") are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us.  These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of alleged defects in our products; product warranties; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions, and fuel economy or other matters; government incentives; tax matters, including trade and customs; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; environmental matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters.  Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.  Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts, or demands for field service actions, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, loss of government incentives, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.\n\n\nThe extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate.  Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum.  To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome.\n\n\nWe accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.  In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar\n\n\nnature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential loss.  We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time.\n\n\nFor the majority of matters, which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products, we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters.  We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters.\n\n\nFor the remaining matters, where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value (i.e., \"non-pattern matters\"), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances.  For non-pattern matters, we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated.Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax and customs matters, for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about $1.4billion.\n\n\nAs noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.  Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed.\n\n\n172\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 25.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES(Continued)\n\n\nWarranty and Field Service Actions\n\n\nWe accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.  Warranty and field service action obligations are reported inOther liabilities and deferred revenue.  We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.\n\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain.  Recoveries are reported inTrade and other receivables, netandOther assets.\n\n\nThe estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries, for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\nBeginning balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,451\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,193\n\n\nPayments made during the period\n\n\n(4,166)\n\n\n(4,779)\n\n\nChanges in accrual related to warranties issued during the period\n\n\n4,028\n\n\n4,743\n\n\nChanges in accrual related to pre-existing warranties\n\n\n1,134\n\n\n2,648\n\n\nForeign currency translation and other\n\n\n(254)\n\n\n(301)\n\n\nEnding balance\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,193\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,504\n\n\nChanges to our estimated costs are reported as changes in accrual related to pre-existing warranties in the table above.  Our estimate of reasonably possible costs in excess of our accruals for material field service actions and customer satisfaction actions is a range of up to about $1.3billion in the aggregate.\n\n\n173\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 26.SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n\nWe report segment information consistent with the way our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") evaluates the operating results and performance of the Company.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we implemented a new operating model and reporting structure.  As a result of this change, we analyze the results of our business through the following segments:  Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro (combined, replacing the previous Automotive segment), Ford Next (previously the Mobility segment), and Ford Credit.  Company adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") includes the financial results of these five reportable segments and Corporate Other, and net income comprises the financial results of the five reportable segments and Corporate Other, as well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.\n\n\nAdditionally, past service pension and OPEB income and expense plus related assets, previously reported in the Automotive segment, have been realigned to Corporate Other.\n\n\nPrior period amounts were adjusted retrospectively to reflect each of the above changes.\n\n\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities.\n\n\nFord Blue Segment\n\n\nFord Blue primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln internal combustion engine (\"ICE\") and hybrid vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing Ford and Lincoln ICE and hybrid vehicles.  Additionally, this segment provides hardware engineering and manufacturing capabilities to Ford Model e and manufactures vehicles on behalf of Ford Pro and, in certain cases, Ford Model e.  Ford Blue also includes:\n\n\n\u2022All sales for markets not presently in scope for Ford Model e or Ford Pro (as further described below)\n\n\n\u2022In markets outside of the United States and Canada, sales to commercial, government, and rental customers of ICE and hybrid vehicles not considered core to Ford Pro\n\n\n\u2022Sales of electric vehicles (\"EVs\") by our unconsolidated affiliates in China\n\n\n\u2022All sales of vehicles manufactured and sold to other OEMs\n\n\nFord Model e Segment\n\n\nFord Model e primarily includes the sale of our electric vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing EV and digital vehicle technologies, as well as software development.  Additionally, Ford Model e provides software and connected vehicle technologies on behalf of the enterprise, and manufactures certain EVs, including for Ford Pro.  Ford Model e operates in North America, Europe, and China.  Ford Model e also includes EV and related sales not considered core to Ford Pro to commercial, government, and rental customers in Europe, China, and Mexico.\n\n\nFord Pro Segment\n\n\nFord Pro primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, accessories, and services for commercial, government, and rental customers.  Included in this segment are sales of all core Ford Pro vehicles, such as Super Duty and the Transit range of vans in North America and Europe and all sales of Ranger in Europe.  In the United States and Canada, Ford Pro also includes all vehicle sales to commercial, government, and rental customers.  This segment focuses on selling ICE, hybrid, and electric vehicles, and providing digital and physical services to optimize and maintain fleets, including telematics and EV charging solutions.  This segment reflects external sales of vehicles produced by Ford Blue and Ford Model e and the costs (including intersegment markup) associated with acquiring vehicles for sale and providing services.  Ford Pro operates in North America and Europe.\n\n\nFord Next Segment\n\n\nThe Ford Next segment (formerly the Mobility segment) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments.\n\n\n174\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 26.  SEGMENT INFORMATION(Continued)\n\n\nFord Credit Segment\n\n\nThe Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-related financing and leasing activities.\n\n\nCorporate Other\n\n\nCorporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending.  Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.  These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company's interests.  Corporate Other assets include:  cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, tax related assets, defined benefit pension plan net assets, and other assets managed centrally.\n\n\nInterest on Debt\n\n\nInterest on Debt is presented as a separate reconciling item and consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.\n\n\nSpecial Items\n\n\nSpecial Items are presented as a separate reconciling item.  They consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii) significant personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.  Our management ordinarily excludes these items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.  We also report these special items separately to help investors track amounts related to these activities and to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results.\n\n\n175\n\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nNOTE 26.  SEGMENT INFORMATION(Continued)\n\n\nSegment Revenue, Cost, and Asset Principles for Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro\n\n\nExternal vehicle and digital services revenue is generally vehicle-specific and included in the segment responsible for the external vehicle sale.  A majority of parts and accessories revenue and cost is attributed to customer sales channels or vehicle lines based on recent end customer sales and is included in the respective segment.\n\n\nIn the normal course of business, Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro transact between segments and cooperate to leverage synergies, including developing and manufacturing vehicles on behalf of another segment.  When one segment produces a vehicle that is sold externally by another segment, an intersegment transaction occurs.  The producing segment will report intersegment revenue to recoup the costs associated with the unit produced.  This includes material cost, labor and overhead (including depreciation and amortization), inbound freight, and an intersegment markup.  The intersegment markup amount is set to deliver a competitive return to the producing segment for its manufacturing and distribution service.  Costs are reflected in the associated segment externally reporting the vehicle sale, as detailed in the table below:\n\n\nIncome Statement Elements\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nSegment Reporting\n\n\nCosts specific to a particular vehicle\n\n\nBill of material cost and initial warranty accrual\n\n\nReported in the segment externally selling the vehicle\n\n\nCosts identifiable by product line\n\n\nManufacturing and logistics costs, depreciation & amortization expense, direct research & development costs\n\n\nTypically identifiable to the product line or production location.  Reported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, based on relative volume\n\n\nShared costs\n\n\nSelling, general & administrative expense, and indirect/cross product line research & development costs\n\n\nTypically shared across all segments, generally based on relative volume.  Certain costs clearly linked to a segment are reported in the specific segment\n\n\nIntersegment markup for intersegment vehicle transactions\n\n\nContract manufacturing and distribution fees\n\n\nReported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, for each applicable vehicle transaction\n\n\nAssets are reported in each segment, aligned to the appropriate operational responsibility.  Manufacturing assets, e.g., our plants and the machinery and equipment therein, are included in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e segments.  Manufacturing assets producing only, or primarily, EVs and related components are reflected in Ford Model e.  Manufacturing assets that support the production of ICE and hybrid vehicles, including those producing ICE and electric in the same facility, are included in Ford Blue.  Vendor tooling dedicated to producing EV parts is reported in Ford Model e.  There are no Ford manufacturing or vendor tooling assets reported in Ford Pro.  Regardless of the segment reporting the asset, depreciation and amortization expense is reflected on the basis of production volume and reported in the segment that reports the external vehicle sale.\n\n\nEquity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companiesis included inIncome/(Loss) before income taxes, based primarily on which segment the entity supports or has the majority of the entity's purchases or sales.

We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and AVs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\n\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our established vehicle franchises and customer base and scaling our EV production through this decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), including Super Cruise driver assistance technology, and our end-to-end software platform. Additionally, we are incubating several new businesses that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas, like GM Defense which is helping global defense and government customers transition to a more electric, autonomous and connected future.\n\n\nElectric VehiclesWe plan to have annual EV capacity of one million units in North America as we exit 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our dedicated EV propulsion architecture. This platform is flexible and will be deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles. We plan to leverage Ultium to expand our EV portfolio over a wide variety of segments and price points with multiple launches planned in 2024 and additional EV entries planned for 2025 and beyond.\n\n\nIn 2021, we began production at GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the upcoming Cadillac ESCALADE IQ. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2025. GM is also investing in our propulsion stamping and components plants to support EV production. GM's CAMI Assembly \u2013 Canada's first full-scale EV manufacturing facility \u2013 is the global production home of BrightDrop's Zevo 600 and Zevo 400. Additionally, we have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Warren, Ohio; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Lansing, Michigan.\n\n\nGM's commitment to an all-electric future is focused not only on delivering a world-class portfolio of EVs, but investing in an ecosystem that will help enable mass EV adoption, including the development of turn-key charging solutions as well as fleet and facility energy management services. To support this goal, we are working to help ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive energy management and fast, reliable charging solutions at home, at the workplace and in public locations. Currently, GM has integration relationships with 12 EV charging networks and GM EV drivers have access to over 174,000 chargers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Beginning in early 2024, GM's EV drivers will gain access to 15,000 Tesla Superchargers, and growing, throughout North America. The first GM EVs will be built with the North American Charging\n\n\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nStandard (NACS) hardware on the vehicles beginning in 2025. In July 2023, GM also announced that it is collaborating with six other major automakers as part of a joint venture that will seek to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America.\n\n\nSoftware-Enabled Services and SubscriptionsOur vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With more than 25 years of experience, OnStar is a global leader in safety and digital services. OnStar is currently available in 15 markets globally and growing. As GM introduces more software-defined vehicles, OnStar is playing a key role as an enabler of active safety, infotainment, connectivity and driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of digital technology offerings available at and after vehicle purchase. Our end-to-end software platform provides customers with software-defined features, apps and services over-the-air and will empower customers to update their ownership experiences with desirable features, software services, vehicle performance and Super Cruise. Super Cruise enables drivers of properly equipped vehicles to travel hands-free on more than 400,000 miles of compatible roads in the U.S. and Canada. Additional software-enabled features will be available later including security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV ownership experience elements. Select vehicles, including the 2024 Cadillac LYRIQ and Chevrolet Silverado EV, are already employing this software platform as it begins its rollout across most products in the coming years.\n\n\nCruiseGM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, is pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology. In October 2023, a hit-and-run accident involving a pedestrian and a third-party vehicle occurred, which resulted in the pedestrian being thrown into the path of a Cruise AV. During the resulting investigation, regulators perceived that Cruise representatives were not explicit about a secondary movement of the Cruise AV and, as a result, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) suspended Cruise's permits to operate AVs in California without a safety driver. Shortly thereafter, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV operations in the U.S. while it examines its processes, systems and tools. This orderly pause is designed to rebuild public trust while Cruise undertakes a comprehensive safety review. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy.\n\n\nCompetitive Position and Vehicle SalesThe principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy or range and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.\n\n\nWe present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors, as well as sales to the U.S. government, and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2023, 29.4% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nGMNA\n\n\n3,147\n\n\n83.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,926\n\n\n81.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,308\n\n\n80.7\n\n\n%\n\n\nGMI\n\n\n621\n\n\n16.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n653\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n551\n\n\n19.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n3,768\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,579\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,859\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) certain vehicles used by dealers in their business. Total vehicle sales data for periods presented prior to 2022 reflect courtesy transportation vehicles used by U.S. dealers in their business. Beginning in 2022, we stopped including such dealership courtesy transportation vehicles in total vehicle sales until such time as those vehicles were sold to the end customer. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\n\n\n2\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\nGM\n\n\nMarket Share\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\nGM\n\n\nMarket Share\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\nGM\n\n\nMarket Share\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n15,981\n\n\n2,595\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n14,242\n\n\n2,274\n\n\n16.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n15,410\n\n\n2,218\n\n\n14.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n3,592\n\n\n460\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,066\n\n\n406\n\n\n13.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,081\n\n\n355\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal North America\n\n\n19,573\n\n\n3,055\n\n\n15.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n17,307\n\n\n2,680\n\n\n15.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n18,491\n\n\n2,574\n\n\n13.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nAsia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\n\n\nChina(a)\n\n\n24,976\n\n\n2,099\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n23,489\n\n\n2,303\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n25,843\n\n\n2,892\n\n\n11.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n21,941\n\n\n576\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n20,253\n\n\n505\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n19,783\n\n\n435\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\n\n\n46,917\n\n\n2,675\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n43,741\n\n\n2,808\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n45,626\n\n\n3,326\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n2,307\n\n\n328\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n291\n\n\n13.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,119\n\n\n242\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n1,418\n\n\n128\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n1,563\n\n\n160\n\n\n10.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n1,490\n\n\n152\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal South America\n\n\n3,725\n\n\n456\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,666\n\n\n451\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,609\n\n\n394\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal in GM markets\n\n\n70,215\n\n\n6,186\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n64,715\n\n\n5,939\n\n\n9.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n67,726\n\n\n6,294\n\n\n9.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal Europe\n\n\n16,384\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n14,234\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\n15,108\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal Worldwide(b)(c)\n\n\n86,600\n\n\n6,188\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n78,949\n\n\n5,941\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n82,834\n\n\n6,296\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n%\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\nCars\n\n\n3,054\n\n\n224\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,814\n\n\n214\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,277\n\n\n138\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nTrucks\n\n\n4,249\n\n\n1,303\n\n\n30.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n3,974\n\n\n1,246\n\n\n31.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n4,038\n\n\n1,223\n\n\n30.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nCrossovers\n\n\n8,678\n\n\n1,068\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n7,454\n\n\n814\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n8,095\n\n\n857\n\n\n10.6\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal United States\n\n\n15,981\n\n\n2,595\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n14,242\n\n\n2,274\n\n\n16.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n15,410\n\n\n2,218\n\n\n14.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nChina(a)\n\n\nSGMS\n\n\n870\n\n\n1,037\n\n\n1,277\n\n\nSGMW\n\n\n1,229\n\n\n1,266\n\n\n1,615\n\n\nTotal China\n\n\n24,976\n\n\n2,099\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n23,489\n\n\n2,303\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n25,843\n\n\n2,892\n\n\n11.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Includes sales by the Automotive China Joint Ventures (Automotive China JVs): SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd.

We sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nGMNA\n\n\n679\n\n\n564\n\n\n399\n\n\nGMI\n\n\n506\n\n\n426\n\n\n311\n\n\nTotal fleet sales\n\n\n1,185\n\n\n990\n\n\n710\n\n\nFleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales\n\n\n19.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n16.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nProduct PricingSeveral methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives, such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products.\n\n\nCyclical and Seasonal Nature of BusinessThe market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries.\n\n\nRelationship with DealersWe market vehicles and automotive parts primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents performing similar functions were 4,618 in GMNA and 7,050 in GMI at December 31, 2023.\n\n\nWe, and our joint ventures, enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those products to customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts, which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.\n\n\nThe quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success, now, and as we transition to our all-electric future, given that they maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.\n\n\nResearch, Product Development and Intellectual PropertyCosts for research, manufacturing engineering, software engineering, product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $9.9 billion, $9.8 billion and $7.9 billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nProduct DevelopmentThe Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing, validating and integrating all global products, services and their components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where our global teams in Design, Program Management & Execution, Hardware, Systems & Integration, Product Safety, Systems & Certification, Software Defined Vehicle Embedded Platforms, Electrification & Battery Systems, Technology Acceleration & Commercialization and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.\n\n\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nWe continue to invest in key ICE segments, which are critical to fund our all-electric future. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our vehicle portfolio profitability, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle sales volume expected to come from five internal combustion vehicle architectures through this decade. We will continue to leverage our ICE portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.\n\n\nSoftware & ServicesThe newly created Software & Services organization, with a presence in Silicon Valley, California and globally, is bringing together all of GM's software capabilities and assets under one team for the first time at GM. The team is developing and implementing an integrated strategy, working closely with the Global Product Development organization and others across the enterprise to deliver an end-to-end integrated software and services strategy that will make the driver experience even more compelling and seamless.\n\n\nIntellectual PropertyWe are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.\n\n\nRaw Materials, Services and SuppliesWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials, systems, components, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead, precious metals and raw materials used in EVs. We do not normally carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements, and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, we have recently experienced supply disruptions resulting in temporary production stoppages. Processing of certain EV raw materials required for production of EVs are currently concentrated in China and may be subject to import or export restrictions. In addition, our transition to EVs will require developing a more resilient, scalable and sustainable North America-focused EV supply chain, which includes advancing our strategic sourcing initiatives to secure supply through investments in raw materials suppliers and the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements with suppliers throughout the value chain. This includes securing supply through offtake agreements for EV raw materials and derivatives thereof, such as lithium, cathode active material, manganese, synthetic and natural graphite, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements and permanent motor magnets. These EV-related agreements may require us to hold higher than normal levels of EV raw materials inventory and to make long-term commitments to purchase raw materials. Expected demand for these raw materials currently exceeds the capacity of the existing supply chain and our raw material sourcing strategy aims to secure raw material supply to support our EV transition.\n\n\nCommodity costs are reflecting greater variability and are expected to remain elevated due to the macro-economic environment and the continuing existence of government policies. Furthermore, an increased demand for EV critical minerals is increasing scrutiny of the sustainability and human rights implications of these supply chains.\n\n\nIn some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, which may increase risk to supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 11% of our total purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and approximately 12% of our total purchases in the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.\n\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM FinancialGM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in China.\n\n\nGM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum to support vehicle sales. Additionally, GM Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used vehicle inventory; and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain GM subsidiaries.\n\n\nIn North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending.\n\n\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nGM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\nThe foundation of GM's business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It is why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain and develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being and promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Fundamental to these commitments are our company values.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nOur eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture; and how we behave\u202fencompasses key measures of our performance, including the ways we conduct ourselves as we work with one another.\n\n\nDiversity, Equity and InclusionAt GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion for our workforce, business partners, customers and communities as we aspire to be the most inclusive company in the world. We believe these strengths will allow us to not only lead the industry but to impact communities around the world as we transition to an all-electric future. This unwavering commitment includes taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are supportive of a world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the people within our Company, which is why we are committed to fostering a culture that celebrates our differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is currently made up of almost 50% women (6 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically diverse (4 out of 13 members).\n\n\nBased on these longstanding values, we have a number of programs and partnerships aimed at enhancing our culture of inclusion throughout the Company. For example, we have 12 voluntary, employee-led resource groups that provide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a variety of different backgrounds to share experiences and contribute to our collective cultural intelligence and growth. Each group also works to attract and retain new talent and offers employees opportunities to support our Company's diversity initiatives within the community.\n\n\nGM continues to align DEI efforts with business objectives, including investing in talent pipelines to support current and future workforce needs, bolstering inclusive and accessible solutions across all key stakeholders and fostering meaningful community partnerships to enable GM's all-electric future. These investments are designed to help increase overall DEI maturity throughout our enterprise, increasing pathways for talent entry and development in the Company and foster partnerships that improve equity inside and outside of GM.\n\n\nDevelop and Retain Talented PeopleToday, we compete for talent against other automotive companies and against businesses in other sectors, such as technology. To win and keep top talent, we must provide a workplace culture that encourages employee behaviors aligned with our values, fulfills employees' long-term individual aspirations and provides experiences that make individuals feel valued, included and engaged. In furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our talent. In addition to mentoring and networking opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to help develop, grow and enable employees to make the most of their careers at GM. Formal resources include, among other things, the Technical Education Program, which offers our employees an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs at leading universities, and our Degreed Learning Platform, which brings forth a variety of external and in-house content in learning pathways and other micro learnings. It is also tied to our GM competency and skills model. Employees in some of our technical roles also have the opportunity to participate in the\n\n\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nGM Technical Learning University \u2014 a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical prowess of our workforce.\n\n\nGM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. All new managers in the Company are entered into a three-month immersive learning program and all new executives come together for an upskilling and targeted development program designed around the GM leadership profile.\n\n\nSafety and Well-BeingThe safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely \u2014 Every Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to \"Speak Up for Safety\" and the Employee Safety Concern Process. These resources make it easier for salaried, hourly or represented and contract employees to report potential vehicle or workplace safety issues, or to suggest safety related improvements without fear of retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and stimulate creativity and innovation.\n\n\nOur award-winning Total Rewards package includes support for physical, emotional and financial wellness. We provide a comprehensive, competitive offering that includes compensation, a 401(k) company contribution and matching program, paid time off for holidays and vacations, a high-quality health care plan, and GM Family First savings on GM vehicles, parts, and services. We are committed to creating spaces where people can show up and thrive as their authentic selves at work as well as at home. GM encourages and supports healthy behaviors, attitudes and actions in our workplaces to improve health outcomes for team members and their families and to contribute to the success of our business.\n\n\nEmployeesAt December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 87,000 (54%) hourly employees and approximately 76,000 (46%) salaried employees. At December 31, 2023, approximately 46,000 (46%) of our U.S. employees were represented by unions, a majority of which were represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).

Each of the officers named above was elected by the Board of Directors to hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.\n\n\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Matters\n\n\nAutomotive Criteria Emissions ControlOur products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain non-GHG automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very little harmonization. Regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n\n\nThe U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Various other states have adopted California emission standards, and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission standards in the future. The EPA has issued a proposal for its Tier 4 Multipollutant Rule that will begin with the 2027 model year. The historically stringent proposal calls for ever-increasing volumes of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) in order to maintain compliance.\n\n\nFor each model year, we must obtain certification that our vehicles and engines will meet emission requirements of the EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and the states that have adopted California emission standards.\n\n\nThe Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal requirements.\n\n\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nIn 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6 combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b was implemented in July 2023. In 2022, China began studies regarding the next generation of vehicle emission standards (China 7), which will likely be influenced by the European (Euro 7) standards.\n\n\nBrazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as L7, implemented in 2022, and L8, to be implemented from 2025 onward. L7 standards cover vehicle exhaust emissions, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and noise limits, and include additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include corporate average vehicle emissions targets, which increase in stringency every two years until 2031. Some of the requirements are aligned with those of the EPA.\n\n\nAs a result of the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business), GM's vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In Europe, increased scrutiny of emission standards compliance may result in changes to these standards, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. Beyond this, as a part of the EU's desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility, the EU is looking to develop stricter emission standards (Euro 7) for all vehicles (including cars, vans, lorries and buses), as it moves to end the sale of ICE vehicles past 2035, and place requirements on batteries to be used in EVs. For additional information, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nAutomotive Fuel Economy and GHG EmissionsIn the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestic cars, import cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers may use one or a combination of the following to resolve fleet deficits: credits from the five prior model years, expected credits for the next three model years, credits obtained from other manufacturers or payment of civil penalties. Manufacturers that do not resolve deficits for a model year may be subject to substantial civil penalties. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards. NHTSA and the EPA have separately finalized standards with differing stringency levels and affected model years, with the CAFE standards addressing the 2024\u20132026 model years and the GHG standards addressing the 2023\u20132026 model years and both standards have been challenged through litigation. NHTSA has also proposed CAFE standards for the 2027\u20132031 model years and the EPA has proposed standards for the 2027\u20132032 model years that are not yet final. NHTSA and the EPA have also proposed on-going fuel efficiency and GHG emissions requirements for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. These requirements also increase in stringency over time.\n\n\nIn addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other states have asserted the right to adopt CARB's standards. CARB regulations previously stated that compliance with the light-duty EPA GHG program is deemed compliance with CARB standards. However, in December 2018, CARB amended this regulation to state that, in the event the EPA were to alter federal GHG stringency, which it now has, compliance with the EPA's GHG emission standards will no longer be deemed compliance with CARB's separate requirements. While NHTSA and the EPA previously took actions to preempt California's GHG standards, NHTSA repealed its assertion of preemption and the EPA rescinded its withdrawal of California's preemption waiver, enabling CARB to enforce GHG standards from the Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) program for the 2021\u20132025 model years. As a result, GM is required to meet state GHG standards in California and the states that have adopted California's GHG standards. The EPA's rescission of its withdrawal of California's waiver has been challenged through litigation. CARB has not proposed separate GHG standards for the 2026 or later model years, but may do so in the future.\n\n\nCARB has also imposed a requirement that increases percentages of ZEVs that must be sold in California. While NHTSA and the EPA previously took actions to preempt California's ZEV standards, NHTSA repealed its assertion of preemption and the EPA rescinded its withdrawal of California's waiver, enabling CARB and the other adopting states to enforce ZEV standards from the ACC program. The EPA's rescission of its withdrawal of California's waiver has been challenged through litigation. Further, in August 2022, CARB finalized its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program, including ZEV standards requiring increasing percentages of ZEVs for the 2026\u20132035 model years, ending with a 100% sales target in the 2035 model year. CARB must obtain a waiver from the EPA to implement its ACC II program. Additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt CARB's ACC and ACC II requirements in the future.\n\n\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nIn Canada, federal light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the U.S. EPA GHG emission standards given the integrated nature of the auto sector between Canada and the U.S. The Canadian light-duty GHG standards continue to largely align with the U.S. EPA GHG standards for the 2023\u20132026 model years. Additionally, in 2022, the Canadian federal government issued the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan requiring the implementation of increasingly stringent ZEV supply regulations for the 2026\u20132035 model years starting with 20% ZEVs in the 2026 model year and ending with 100% in the 2035 model year. The Canadian federal government recently published the ZEV Availability Standard outlining the regulatory requirements for ZEV supply in Canada, with non-compliance resulting in enforcement action up to and including criminal charges. Additionally, both Quebec and British Columbia have ZEV sales requirements in place where non-compliance results in monetary penalties. Quebec's ZEV requirements regulating the 2018\u20132025 model years are largely based on California program requirements. Quebec recently passed new light-duty ZEV regulations for the 2025\u20132035 model years that are more stringent than the California program requirements. The province of British Columbia's light-duty ZEV regulations were completed in July 2020 and cover the 2020\u20132039 model years. British Columbia has proposed revised and very aggressive regulatory ZEV sales targets for the 2026\u20132035 model years, including a stringent 90% ZEV by the 2030 model year leading up to a 100% in the 2035 model year, making it the most stringent ZEV regulation of any jurisdiction in North America.\n\n\nChina has two fuel consumption requirements for passenger vehicles enforced by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT): an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) requirement. Specific to the CAFC requirement, China introduced Phase 5 in 2021 with full compliance required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), from 2019 and beyond. The number of NEV credits per car is based on the electric range, energy efficiency and battery energy density with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the corporate average fuel consumption requirement. China previously issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and has set new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing NEV volumes for 2024 and 2025. In 2022, China began to study the CAFC requirement and NEV credit mandates for 2026\u20132030 (referred to as Phase 6). These standards are anticipated to be more stringent, aligned with the trend observed in other key global markets.\n\n\nIn Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE program for the period October 2020\u2013September 2026 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and SUVs, including diesel vehicles. The next phases of the program are yet to be finalized and are expected to gradually become more stringent.\n\n\nWe have several options to comply with existing and potential new regulations that we have utilized and may continue to utilize, including increasing production and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of others, which could include profitable ICE vehicles; technology changes, including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties; and/or the purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.\n\n\nGM remains committed to an all-electric future. The Company has approved science-based targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 (Category 11) emissions and has announced plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. In addition, the Company plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles in the U.S. by 2035. These targets align with our growth and transformation plan, including our commitment to an all-electric future.\n\n\nIndustrial Environmental ControlOur operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.\n\n\nTo further mitigate the impacts of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are supplementing our compliance programs with sustainability efforts focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and operational waste.\n\n\nWe have surpassed our goal of diverting more than 90% of our operational waste from landfills, incinerators and energy recovery facilities by 2025, compared to our 2018 baseline, and are now building upon our strategies and ambitions. We also continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables. We have finalized the energy sourcing agreements required to secure 100% of the energy needed to power all\n\n\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nour U.S. facilities with renewable energy by the end of 2025. This is in line with the accelerated target announced in September 2021 and 25 years ahead of the initial target of 2050, set in 2016. We are on target to meet the remaining needs of our global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2035.\n\n\nChemical RegulationsWe continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.\n\n\nGlobally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions on Chemicals and Waste, the Minamata Convention on Mercury and EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose substances of concern in parts.\n\n\nChemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. The EPA has also issued a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule that requires PFAS use reporting by manufacturers between 2011 and 2022. In addition, several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and use requirements. For example, Maine and Minnesota will  require the reporting of PFAS in 2025 and 2026 and the elimination of PFAS in 2030 and 2032, except for unavoidable uses. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic.\n\n\nThese emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers, including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties, production disruptions or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.\n\n\nVehicle Safety\n\n\nU.S. RequirementsThe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the U.S. of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\n\nOther National RequirementsOutside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. Safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are generally aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Global regulations continue to increase in scope\n\n\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nwith new technologies, some of which can be market-specific, that can add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.\n\n\nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment ProgramsOrganizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars or other grading systems, depending on the region, to rate vehicle safety. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.\n\n\nWebsite Access to Our ReportsOur internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n\nRisks related to our competition and strategy\n\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer needs and preferences, our business could suffer.We believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years, particularly as traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) continue to shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of start-ups and other non-traditional competitors in the automotive industry, such as software and ridesharing services supported by large technology companies. These new competitors, as well as established industry participants, are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer sales channels, methods of transportation and vehicle ownership. To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and services, including products and services that are outside of our historically core ICE business, such as EVs and AVs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, our ability to execute on our strategic plans could be adversely affected. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs and preferences, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be materially harmed.\n\n\nOur ability to attract and retain talented, diverse and highly skilled employees is critical to our success and competitiveness.Our success depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled\n\n\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nin their areas. In particular, our vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex and our success in this area is dependent upon our ability to retain and recruit the best talent. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In addition to compensation considerations, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on culture and other various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\n\nOur ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.We operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features, at decreasing price points, designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, crossovers, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, including tax credits or other government policies in various countries, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\n\nOur long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of EVs.The production and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we continue our transition to an all-electric future. Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a strategic portfolio of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer demands; scale our EV manufacturing capabilities; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to battery cells and packs; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; efficiently source sufficient materials for the manufacture of battery cells; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles. Our progress towards these objectives has impacted, and may continue to impact, the need to record losses on our EV-related inventory, including battery cells.\n\n\nIn addition, the success of our long-term strategy is dependent on consumer adoption of EVs. Consumer adoption of EVs could be impacted by numerous factors, including the breadth of the portfolio of EVs available; perceptions about EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost relative to ICE vehicles; the range over which EVs may be driven on a given battery charge; the proliferation and speed of charging infrastructure, in particular with respect to public EV charging stations, and the success of the Company's charging infrastructure programs and strategic joint ventures and other relationships; cost and availability of high fuel-economy ICE vehicles; volatility, or a sustained decrease, in the cost of petroleum-based fuel; failure by governments and other third parties to make the investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, and to provide meaningful and fully utilizable economic incentives promoting the adoption of EVs, including production and consumer credits contemplated by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); and negative feedback from stakeholders impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry. If we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects, and could negatively impact our brand and reputation.\n\n\nOur near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of ICE vehicles, particularly our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.While we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a strategic portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize the highest profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks. As a result, our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We are also using the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including with respect to EVs and AVs. Any near-term shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability (such as related to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza), concerns about fuel consumption or GHG emissions, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles. More stringent fuel economy\n\n\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nregulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs associated with these vehicles, which could be material. See \"Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\"\n\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.The global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, despite the fact that OEMs have experienced supply constraints in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and certain supply chain and logistics challenges, overall manufacturing capacity in the automotive industry has historically far exceeded demand, and we expect conditions to normalize in the near term. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to efficiently close facilities and reduce fixed costs, including as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we have had, and may in the future need, to offer similar incentives, which may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness.\n\n\nManufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging markets and have begun offering their products in established markets, as well as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results in these markets.\n\n\nOur AV strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks, including the various regulatory approvals and permits required for operating driverless AVs in multiple markets.Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, is pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology. Our AV operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital; risks related to the manufacture of purpose-built AVs; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to AV technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the commercial deployment of AVs on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, reputation of our brand, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal, state, provincial or local regulations. Advanced technologies such as AVs present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas, and our relationships with regulators, could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty. In order for Cruise to successfully execute its business plan and achieve its revenue targets, legislation and regulations must evolve to permit widespread commercial AV deployment. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, reputational harm, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter consumer adoption of AV technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\n\n\nIn October 2023, a hit-and-run accident involving a pedestrian and a third-party vehicle occurred, which resulted in the pedestrian being thrown into the path of a Cruise AV. During the resulting investigation, regulators perceived that Cruise representatives were not explicit about a secondary movement of the Cruise AV and, as a result, the California DMV suspended Cruise's permits to operate AVs in California without a safety driver. Shortly thereafter, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV operations in the U.S. while it examines its processes, systems and tools. This orderly pause is designed to rebuild public trust while Cruise undertakes a comprehensive safety review. In addition, certain federal and state agencies, including the California DMV, the California Public Utilities Commission, NHTSA, the U.S. Department of\n\n\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nJustice and the SEC, have opened investigations or made inquiries in connection with the incident. We and Cruise are investigating these matters internally and intend to cooperate with all government regulators and agencies in connection with these matters. At this time, we are not able to predict when Cruise will resume driverless testing or commercial AV operations.\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.Increasing attention to climate change, rising societal expectations on companies to address climate change, requirements for increased disclosure and changes in consumer and investor preferences may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements, risks to our reputation and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. Regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our ICE vehicles. See \"Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\" In addition, at the state and federal level in the U.S. and abroad there are an increasing number of sustainability-related rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed. Such regulations may subject us to new disclosure requirements, new supply chain requirements, new trade restrictions and increased risk of litigation or regulatory action, which could result in increased costs (in our operations and supply chain) and risks to our reputation or consumer demand for our products if we do not meet increasingly demanding stakeholder expectations and standards. Furthermore, our practices may be judged against sustainability standards that are continually evolving and not always clear. Prevailing sustainability standards, expectations and regulations may also reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas.\n\n\nPart of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to EVs, which presents additional risks, including reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we are using to fund our growth strategy and transition to EVs; higher costs or reduced availability of materials related to EV technologies, whether as a result of increased competition or more stringent regulatory requirements, impacting profitability, particularly with respect to batteries and battery raw material; risks related to the success of our EV strategy, particularly with respect to advancement of battery cell technology, charging infrastructure and competition; and uncertainty over how EVs will be treated under upcoming CAFE regulations. See \"Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of EVs\" and \"Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.\"\n\n\nFinally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts, wildfires or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Such weather events may also adversely impact the financial condition of our customers, and thereby reduce demand for our products and services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nRisks related to our operations\n\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile.Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable financing, elevated interest rates, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence and demand for vehicles, political unrest or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability.Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may\n\n\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\ncontinue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks.Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers, which have experienced significant growth in customer acceptance, as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving industry-leading affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.\n\n\nCertain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. The Chinese government may adopt new regulations that may impact entities operating in China or the ability of non-Chinese entities to obtain critical materials from China, potentially with little advance notice. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements, including under such regulatory actions, that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with short notice. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or limit how we may do business in China, which could materially and adversely affect the profitability and financial condition of our China business.\n\n\nWe benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationships, particularly with respect to facilitating access to raw materials necessary for the production of EVs, and a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit.We are engaged in many strategic business relationships, and we expect that such arrangements will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business, particularly in light of industry consolidation. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationships in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do, or that any strategic business relationships that we enter into will be successful. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business relationships in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In particular, to secure critical materials for the production of EVs, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material suppliers. The terms of these offtake agreements may obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output over a specified period of time, subject to certain conditions. If we are unable to utilize or otherwise monetize the raw materials we are obligated to purchase under these offtake agreements, whether as a result of lower than expected EV production volumes, changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials or other reasons, it could materially adversely affect our cash flows and increase our inventory. Further, our investments in raw materials suppliers could expose us to distinct risks not traditionally associated with the automotive sector, and if the raw materials suppliers in which we have invested are unsuccessful, our investments could lose their value.\n\n\nIn addition, many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as certain of our battery manufacturing and raw material sourcing operations in the U.S. and Canada, are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, business incentives or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures, we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. Further, because most of the benefits\n\n\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nfrom a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.\n\n\nIn addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties. Moreover, a joint venture may not be subject to the same financial reporting, corporate governance, or compliance approaches that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive actions, or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other punitive actions or suffer reputational harm for these activities.\n\n\nThe international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks.We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in trade compliance, labor, employment, tax, privacy, environmental and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives (including with respect to full utilization of the incentives contemplated by the IRA); (4) political uncertainty, instability, civil unrest, government controls over certain sectors or human rights concerns; (5) political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international economic policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends or in the export of technology, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) changes to customs requirements or procedures (e.g., inspections) or new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the U.S., including under U.S. or other trade laws or measures, or other key markets; (7) new or evolving non-tariff barriers or domestic preference procurement requirements, or enforcement of, changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements, or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic downturns or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle emissions, EVs and AVs, connected services and safety; (11) impact of changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls, economic sanctions and other similar measures; (12) impacts on our operations or liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations, agreements, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships; (15) difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (16) natural disasters, public health crises, and other catastrophic events.\n\n\nAny significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule.We assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. When these or other facilities become unavailable, either temporarily or permanently and for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or shortages, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of a public health crisis or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility has resulted, and may in the future result, in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.\n\n\nIn addition, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from time-to-time, including at the local facility level. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees.\n\n\nDisruption in our suppliers' operations have disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our production schedule.Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw\n\n\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nmaterials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Other than with respect to certain of our offtake agreements with battery raw material suppliers, our use of \"just-in-time\" manufacturing processes typically allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules and specifications. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a public health crisis, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, restrictions on transactions involving certain territories, entities or individuals, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers' operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. When we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules, increase work-in-process inventory or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital, which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\n\nPandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises have disrupted our business and operations, and future public health crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future expectations. Any such events may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to suspend our operations in the affected markets. In particular, we could experience, among other things: (1) continued or additional global supply disruptions; (2) labor disruptions or shortages; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) an inability to sell to our customers; (5) a decline in showroom traffic and customer demand; (6) customer defaults on automobile loans and leases; (7) lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction; and (8) an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets. Any new public health crisis could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations going forward.\n\n\nRisks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\n\nCompetitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM's intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services.There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property. We sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we have been, and in the future may be, the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. In addition, to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\n\nSecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third parties, such as vendors or suppliers, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.We rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information (including that of our dealers and suppliers), as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the\n\n\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nprocessing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source of a cyberattack on, or breach of, our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure.\n\n\nDespite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to intrusion, damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses or worms, malware (including \"ransomware\"), phishing attacks, denial of service attacks or breaches due to errors, negligence or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. Techniques used in cyberattacks to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or sabotage information technology systems are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Data breaches and other cybersecurity events have become increasingly commonplace, including as a result of the intensification of state-sponsored cyberattacks during periods of geopolitical conflict. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in GM and our products.Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and battery and electric motors. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers and other malicious actors have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use networks, vehicle software or their systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to, or control of, our vehicles or their systems or any unauthorized access to or loss of data could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in failure of our systems, any of which could result in interruptions to our business, legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles or their systems or data are capable of being \"hacked\" and lack appropriate safety controls, could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the personal information of our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions.Under these regulations, which include the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018, and other international data protection, privacy, data security, data localization and similar national, state, provincial, and local laws, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as have a negative impact on our brand or result in other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information, with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nRisks related to government regulations and litigation\n\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.We are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to fuel economy standards and GHG emissions. Meeting or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal combustion propulsion vehicles in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay increased penalties, purchase additional credits from our competitors or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our vehicles. These regulatory requirements, among others, could significantly affect our plans for global product development and, given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues and profitability. Refer to the \"Environmental and Regulatory Matters\" section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.\n\n\nWe expect that to comply with fuel economy and GHG emission standards and mandates to sell specific volumes of ZEVs in certain jurisdictions, we will be required to sell a significant volume of EVs, and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix, lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, especially with respect to EVs, the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make batteries and other elements of EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with current or future regulatory requirements.\n\n\nIn the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or vehicle emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines and penalties, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.\n\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Current or any future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\n\nWe could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to various governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, fines, reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as legal and other costs, all of which may be significant. For a further discussion of certain of these matters, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business.Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the industry with respect to new technologies, such as EVs and AVs.\n\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\n\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business (for example, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development proposals, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards), the possibility of tax controversy related to adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws (in particular, with respect to full realization of the incentives contemplated by the IRA), changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n\nRisks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers.GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of funding, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates; competition for customers from commercial banks, credit unions and other financing and leasing companies; and changes to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.\n\n\nIn addition, GM Financial has certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions and floating-rate commercial loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, generally the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. Any uncertainties associated with these benchmark rates may impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk effectively.\n\n\nFurther, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure\n\n\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nto comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\n\n\nRisks related to defined benefit pension plans\n\n\nOur pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in the level of benefits provided for by the plans, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns.Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.\n\n\nOur future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.\n\n\nThere are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.\n\n\nFactors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *None.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *Risk Management and Strategy\n\n\nMaterial risks from cybersecurity threats are managed across GM, GM Financial, Cruise andthird-party suppliers and vendors, and monitoring such risks and threats is integrated into the Company's overall risk management program.\n\n\nGM has a Cybersecurity Management Board that brings together representatives from senior management across the Company's Software & Services, Product Development, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, Communications, Human Resources, Legal and Public Policy organizations to provide guidance and monitor overall company cybersecurity risk. The Company's cybersecurity maturity scorecard, cybersecurity threats and certain incident information are reviewed by the Company's Chief Cybersecurity Officer (CCO), the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Cybersecurity Management Board during standing meetings as well as in impromptu sessions, when appropriate. During the reviews, various topics are discussed, which may include:\n\n\n\u2022implementation and maturity of the Company's cybersecurity program, risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk policies, procedures and governance;\n\n\n\u2022cybersecurity and privacy risk, including potential impact to the Company's employees, customers, supply chain, joint ventures and other stakeholders;\n\n\n\u2022intelligence briefings on notable cyber events impacting the industry; and\n\n\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\n\u2022cybersecurity budget and resource allocation, including industry benchmarking and economic modeling of various potential cybersecurity events.\n\n\nThe Company maintains technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance and business continuity mechanisms for the protection of the Company's assets.  From time to time, the Company's processes are audited and validated by internal and external experts. The Company leverages a third-party cybersecurity program with the goal of minimizing disruption to the Company's business and production operations, strengthening supply chain resilience in response to cyber-related events and supporting the integrity of components and systems used in its products and services.\n\n\nAs cybersecurity incidents occur, the GM Cybersecurity team focuses on responding to and containing the threat and minimizing any business impact, as appropriate. In the event of an incident, the Cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, safety impact, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with support from external technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate.\n\n\nIn the last three fiscal years, the Company has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and expenses incurred from cybersecurity incidents were immaterial (including penalties and settlements, of which there were none). For a discussion of whether and how any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 \"Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\", which are incorporated by reference into this Item 1C.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nThe GM Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's enterprise risk, and has established its Risk and Cybersecurity Committee with specific responsibility for overseeing cybersecurity threats, among other things. The Company's cybersecurity organization is led by the CCO, who is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and reports to GM's Executive Vice President, Legal, Policy, Cybersecurity, and Corporate Secretary as well as to the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee. The CCO has served in this role for four years, and has more than 11 years of experience in various roles involving managing cybersecurity functions, developing cybersecurity strategies to protect privacy, customer safety and intellectual property, and developing key capabilities such as product security engineering, risk management and cybersecurity governance. The CCO holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in systems engineering, with over 10 years of previous software and hardware systems engineering experience. The CCO chairs the Automotive \u2013 Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) and serves on the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS-CISA) Advisory Committee.\n\n\nThe CCO and the Cybersecurity Management Board monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including through the operation of the Company's incident response plans, which include escalation to the CCO and the Cybersecurity Management Board, as appropriate. As discussed above, the CCO reports out to the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee about cybersecurity threat risks, among other cybersecurity related matters, at least quarterly.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *At December 31, 2023, we had over 100 locations in the U.S. (excluding our automotive financing operations and dealerships), which are primarily for manufacturing, assembly, distribution, warehousing, engineering and testing. We, our subsidiaries or associated companies in which we own an equity interest, own most of these properties and/or lease a portion of these properties. Leased properties are primarily composed of warehouses and administration, engineering and sales offices.\n\n\nWe have manufacturing, assembly, distribution, office or warehousing operations in 32 countries, including equity interests in associated companies, which perform manufacturing, assembly or distribution operations. The major facilities outside the U.S., which are principally vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations, are located in Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico and South Korea.\n\n\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThese facilities are used to support our automotive segments and are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business.\n\n\nGM Financial owns or leases facilities for administration and regional credit centers. GM Financial has 35 facilities, of which 22 are located in the U.S. The major facilities outside the U.S. are located in Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company will use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required.\n\n\nIn February 2023, GM self-disclosed potential violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act's (TSCA) requirements applicable to the import of new chemical substances at our Ultium Cells LLC joint venture to the EPA. In November 2023, these potential violations were settled via consent agreement with the EPA, the terms of which include, among other items, payment of civil penalties currently estimated at approximately $5.1 million, which could grow depending upon import activity prior to receipt of a TSCA 5(e) order. These penalties are assessed jointly and severally to GM and Ultium Cells LLC.\n\n\nThe discussion under Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 3.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *Not applicable.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *Market InformationShares of our common stock are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"GM\".\n\n\nHoldersAt January 16, 2024, we had 1.2 billion issued and outstanding shares of common stock held by 462 holders of record.\n\n\nDividendsIn September 2022, our Board of Directors reinstated a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share of our common stock and in December 2023, increased the quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share of our common stock beginning in 2024. We anticipate that we will continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock quarterly. However, the declaration of any dividend on our common stock is a matter to be acted upon by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs, as described further in the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of the MD&A.\n\n\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nStock Performance GraphThe following graph compares the performance of our common stock to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Automobile & Parts Titans 30 Index for the last five years.

Refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in ourAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022is incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\n\n\nOverviewOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in EVs, hybrids, AVs, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. To support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We plan to execute our strategy with a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.\n\n\nOur financial performance in 2023 was driven by the success of high-margin products like full-size pick-ups and SUVs, despite several headwinds, including higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics challenges, and work stoppages associated with recent labor negotiations. This performance was due to the strength of our vehicle portfolio, strong consumer demand and execution of our core business strategy, focused on fixed cost reduction and pricing discipline.\n\n\nIn January 2023, we announced our intention to implement a cost reduction program to reduce automotive fixed costs by $2.0 billion on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2024. This goal includes the impact of higher expected depreciation and amortization expense and inflationary cost increases on fixed cost but excludes changes in our pension income. In March 2023,\n\n\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nwe announced performance-based exits and a voluntary separation program (VSP) in an effort to accelerate attrition, which we believe will result in approximately $1.0 billion towards this target on an annual run rate basis. In addition to people costs, we are reducing our marketing and advertising expenses, streamlining our engineering expense by reducing complexity across the vehicle portfolio, adjusting the cadence of our EV launches due to customer demand, reducing launch-related expenses in the near-term, reprioritizing growth initiatives and reducing our overall overhead and discretionary costs.\n\n\nAs we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. Refer to the Consolidated Results and regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.\n\n\nOur collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, which was ratified in October 2019, expired on September 14, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the UAW initiated a strike at certain of our U.S. facilities and intermittently expanded the strike to additional facilities, causing stoppages to some vehicle production and parts distribution activities across our U.S. operations. We estimate that the lost vehicle production volumes and parts sales due to the UAW strike had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.8 billion on Net income attributable to stockholders and $1.1 billion on our GMNA EBIT-adjusted in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the UAW ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (the Labor Agreement). The Labor Agreement, which continues through April 30, 2028, covers the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our UAW-represented employees. The key terms and provisions of the Labor Agreement are:\n\n\n\u2022General wage increases of 11% upon ratification in 2023, 3% in September each of 2024, 2025 and 2026, and 5% in September 2027;\n\n\n\u2022Consolidation of applicable wage classifications for in-progression, temporary and other employees \u2013 with employees reaching the top classification rate upon the completion of 156 weeks of active service;\n\n\n\u2022The re-establishment of a cost-of-living allowance;\n\n\n\u2022Lump sum ratification bonus payments of $5,000 paid to eligible employees in the three months ended December 31, 2023;\n\n\n\u2022For members currently employed and enrolled in the Employees' Pension Plan, an increase of $5.00 to the monthly basic benefit for past and future service provided;\n\n\n\u2022A 3.6% increase in company contributions to eligible employees' defined contribution retirement accounts; and\n\n\n\u2022Annual contribution of $500 to eligible retirees or surviving spouses.\n\n\nBeginning in 2024 and through the end of the term of the Labor Agreement, GM will offer three separate cash severance incentive programs to UAW-represented employees that meet the normal or early retirement eligibility requirements.\n\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted. The IRA modified climate and clean energy tax provisions and added new corporate tax credits for commercial EV purchases and investments in clean energy production, supply chains and manufacturing facilities. IRA benefits, including credits and lower material costs, are expected to materially affect net income in the future. We will continue to evaluate the IRA impacts on our financial results as additional regulatory guidance is issued.\n\n\nWe face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.\n\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $8.50 and $9.50, Net income attributable to stockholders of between $9.8 billion and $11.2 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $12.0 billion and $14.0 billion. These expected financial results do not include the potential impact of future adjustments related to special items. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this MD&A for additional information.\n\n\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to expected EBIT-adjusted (dollars in billions):\n\n\nYear Ending December 31, 2024\n\n\nNet income attributable to stockholders\n\n\n$ 9.8-11.2\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n2.1-2.7\n\n\nAutomotive interest expense, net\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nEBIT-adjusted(a)\n\n\n$ 12.0-14.0\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.\n\n\nGMNAIndustry sales in North America were 19.6 million units in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 13.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. U.S. industry sales were 16.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 12.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2022.\n\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.6 million units for a market share of 16.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2022.\n\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2024 on the continued strength of our product portfolio, improved EV margins and ongoing fixed cost reduction efforts, partially offset by pricing moderation with increased incentives.  While we expect EV margins to improve in 2024, it is possible that we will continue to recognize losses to adjust inventory to net realizable value. Our outlook is dependent on the resiliency of the U.S. economy, continuing improvement of supply chain availability, EV-related cost reduction and overall economic conditions.\n\n\nGMIIndustry sales in China were 25.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 6.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.1 million units resulting in a market share of 8.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The ongoing supply chain disruptions, global macro-economic conditions and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $0.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023. Price competition, growing customer acceptance of domestic brands and demand for NEVs, and a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEVs have and will continue to place pressure on our operations in China.\n\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 7.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 1.0 million units for a market share of 4.0% in the year ended December 31, 2023, which is comparable to the corresponding period in 2022.\n\n\nCruiseCruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, is pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology. In October 2023, a hit-and-run accident involving a pedestrian and a third-party vehicle occurred, which resulted in the pedestrian being thrown into the path of a Cruise AV. During the resulting investigation, regulators perceived that Cruise representatives were not explicit about a secondary movement of the Cruise AV and, as a result, the California DMV suspended Cruise's permits to operate AVs in California without a safety driver. Shortly thereafter, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV operations in the U.S. while it examines its processes, systems and tools. This orderly pause is designed to rebuild public trust while Cruise undertakes a comprehensive safety review. In addition, certain federal and state agencies, including the California DMV, the California Public Utilities Commission, NHTSA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC, have opened investigations or made inquiries in connection with the incident. We and Cruise are investigating these matters internally and intend to cooperate with all government regulators and agencies in connection with these matters. At this time, we are not able to predict when Cruise will resume driverless testing or commercial AV operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy.\n\n\nIn connection with the pause in operations and Cruise's refocused operational strategy, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.5 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2023, and also expect reductions of approximately $1.0 billion in Cruise expenses in 2024.\n\n\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and OutlookWe believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 42% in the year ended December 31, 2023 and 43% in the corresponding period in 2022. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America was 82% in the year ended December 31, 2023 and 80% in the corresponding period in 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2023, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 51%, retail finance charge income of 37% and commercial finance charge income of 7%.\n\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion were included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The decrease in gains is primarily due to higher leased portfolio net book values at termination and fewer terminated leases in 2023 compared to 2022. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent estimates and the number of units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nResidual Value\n\n\nUnits\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\nResidual Value\n\n\nUnits\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\nCrossovers\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,830\n\n\n648\n\n\n67.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,207\n\n\n736\n\n\n67.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nTrucks\n\n\n6,793\n\n\n210\n\n\n21.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n6,961\n\n\n228\n\n\n20.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nSUVs\n\n\n2,304\n\n\n58\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,595\n\n\n66\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nCars\n\n\n734\n\n\n44\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n964\n\n\n63\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n22,661\n\n\n960\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n24,727\n\n\n1,092\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nConsolidated ResultsWe review changes in our results of operations under five categories: Volume, Mix, Price, Cost and Other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.

The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.\n\n\nFactors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on Volume and Mix.\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, increased Cost was primarily due to: (1) increased campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $2.1 billion; (2) increased EV-related charges of $2.0 billion, primarily due to $1.7 billion in inventory adjustments to reflect the net realizable value at period end; (3) increased manufacturing costs of $0.9 billion; (4) charges of $0.7 billion related to the VSP; (5) increased engineering costs of $0.5 billion, driven primarily by $0.8 billion increase in AV engineering costs; partially offset by $0.4 billion decrease in Automotive engineering cost (6) charges of $0.5 billion related to Cruise restructuring; and (7) increased material and freight costs of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (8) decrease of $0.8 billion due to absence of the charge for the modification of Cruise stock incentive awards in 2022.

Trucks, crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 170%, 40% and 50% of our GMNA portfolio on a weighted-average basis.\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, EBIT-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased Cost primarily due to increased campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $2.0 billion, increased EV-related charges of $1.9 billion primarily due to $1.6 billion in inventory adjustments to reflect the net realizable value at period end, decreased non-service pension income of $1.1 billion and increased manufacturing costs of $0.9 billion, partially offset by decreased advertising, selling and administrative costs of $1.1 billion; and (2) unfavorable Mix associated with increased sales of crossover vehicles partially\n\n\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\noffset by decreased sales of mid-size pickup trucks and passengers cars and increased sales of full-size SUVs; partially offset by (3) favorable Price; and (4) favorable Volume.\n\n\nGM International\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\n\n\nVariance Due To\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n%\n\n\nVolume\n\n\nMix\n\n\nPrice\n\n\nCost\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(Dollars in billions)\n\n\nTotal net sales and revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,949\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,420\n\n\n$\n\n\n529\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\nEBIT-adjusted\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,210\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,143\n\n\n$\n\n\n67\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\nEBIT-adjusted margin\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\nEquity income \u2014 Automotive China\n\n\n$\n\n\n446\n\n\n$\n\n\n677\n\n\n$\n\n\n(231)\n\n\n(34.1)\n\n\n%\n\n\nEBIT-adjusted \u2014 excluding Equity income\n\n\n$\n\n\n764\n\n\n$\n\n\n466\n\n\n$\n\n\n298\n\n\n63.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n(Vehicles in thousands)\n\n\nWholesale vehicle sales\n\n\n621\n\n\n653\n\n\n(32)\n\n\n(4.9)\n\n\n%\n\n\nThe vehicle sales of our Automotive China JVs are not recorded in Total net sales and revenue.

In the coming years, we plan to leverage our global architectures to introduce a number of new product offerings under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands in China and continue to grow our business under the local Baojun and Wuling brands while we are accelerating the development and rollout of EVs across our brands in China as part of our commitment to an all-electric future. We operate in the Chinese market through a number of joint ventures and maintaining strong relationships with our joint venture partners is an important part of our China growth strategy.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes certain key operational and financial data for the Automotive China JVs (vehicles in thousands):\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nWholesale vehicle sales including vehicles exported to markets outside of China\n\n\n2,334\n\n\n2,639\n\n\n3,007\n\n\nTotal net sales and revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n31,435\n\n\n$\n\n\n35,857\n\n\n$\n\n\n42,776\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,122\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,407\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,109\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,875\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,552\n\n\nDebt\n\n\n$\n\n\n202\n\n\n$\n\n\n197\n\n\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nCruise\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal net sales and revenue(a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n102\n\n\n$\n\n\n102\n\n\n$\n\n\n106\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n%\n\n\nEBIT (loss)-adjusted\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,695)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,890)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,196)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(805)\n\n\n(42.6)\n\n\n%\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Primarily reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net in our consolidated income statements in each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nCruise EBIT (Loss)-AdjustedIn the year ended December 31, 2023, EBIT (loss)-adjusted increased primarily due to an increase in development costs as we pursue the development and commercialization of AV technology in the U.S. and globally.\n\n\nGM Financial\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,225\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,766\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,419\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,459\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n%\n\n\nProvision for loan losses\n\n\n$\n\n\n826\n\n\n$\n\n\n654\n\n\n$\n\n\n248\n\n\n$\n\n\n172\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nEBT-adjusted\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,985\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,076\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,036\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,091)\n\n\n(26.8)\n\n\n%\n\n\nAverage debt outstanding (dollars in billions)\n\n\n$\n\n\n100.4\n\n\n$\n\n\n93.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n94.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nEffective rate of interest paid\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n%\n\n\nGM Financial RevenueIn the year ended December 31, 2023, Total revenue increased primarily due to: (1) increased finance charge income of $1.7 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher benchmark interest rates and growth in the size of the portfolio; (2) increased investment income of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in benchmark interest rates; partially offset by (3) decreased leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio.\n\n\nGM Financial EBT-AdjustedIn the year ended December 31, 2023, EBT-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased interest expense of $1.8 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on debt, resulting from higher benchmark interest rates, as well as an increase in average debt outstanding; (2) decreased leased vehicle income net of leased vehicle expenses of $0.9 billion primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio and decreased lease termination gains due to higher leased portfolio net book values at termination and fewer terminated leases; (3) increased provision for loan losses of $0.2 billion due to lower recovery rates in 2023, as well as moderating credit performance; partially offset by (4) increased finance charge income of $1.7 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher benchmark interest rates and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (5) increased investment income of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in benchmark interest rates.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the short- and long-term. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.\n\n\nOur known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion in 2024; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities,including investing in the development and commercialization of AV technology by Cruise; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; and (6) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 7, Note 13 and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are\n\n\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nfocused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors not less than once annually.\n\n\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. To support our transition to EVs, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. In addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. These arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.\n\n\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.\n\n\nIn November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced common stock repurchase program by $10.0 billion to $11.4 billion and approved a $10.0 billion ASR program. On December 1, 2023, we advanced $10.0 billion under the ASR program and received approximately 215 million shares of common stock with a value of $6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. The final settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements is expected to occur no later than the three months ending December 31, 2024. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed $1.1 billion of open market repurchases under the program and retired approximately 30 million shares of our common stock. We have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our common stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2023, with no expiration date.\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid dividends of $0.5 billion to holders of our common stock. We anticipate that we will continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock quarterly.\n\n\nCash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive and Cruise from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.\n\n\nAutomotive LiquidityTotal available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.\n\n\nWe manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Over 85% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2023. We have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\n\nIn March 2023, we redeemed our $1.5 billion, 4.875% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of October 2023 and recorded an insignificant loss.\n\n\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nAlso, in March 2023, we renewed and reduced the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $11.2 billion facility to $10.0 billion, which now matures March 31, 2028. We also renewed and reduced the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.3 billion facility to $4.1 billion, which now matures March 31, 2026, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of GM Financial, which now matures March 30, 2024.\n\n\nIn October 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $6.0 billion, which we terminated on November 24, 2023.\n\n\nIn November 2023, the Company entered an unsecured 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement that permits the Company to borrow up to $3.0 billion in the form of four term loans during an availability period that ends June 28, 2024. Amounts drawn and repaid may not be reborrowed and the final maturity date for any loans outstanding under the delayed draw credit agreement is November 27, 2024.\n\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. Our Automotive borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled $17.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which consisted primarily of three credit facilities, and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities. Total Automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use of GM Financial. We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial continues to have access to our five-year, $10.0 billion and three-year, $4.1 billion credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. We did not have intercompany loans to GM Financial at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2023 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $3.5 billion on its common stock in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.\n\n\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nAutomotive cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n$\n\n\n13.6\n\n\nMarketable debt securities\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n10.8\n\n\nAutomotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\n\n\n19.8\n\n\n24.4\n\n\nAvailable under credit facilities(a)\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n15.1\n\n\nTotal Automotive available liquidity\n\n\n$\n\n\n36.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n39.5\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a) We had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n\n\nOperating cash flow\n\n\n$\n\n\n20.8\n\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n\n(10.7)\n\n\nASR program\n\n\n(10.0)\n\n\nDividends paid and payments to purchase common stock\n\n\n(1.6)\n\n\nPayment of senior unsecured note\n\n\n(1.5)\n\n\nInvestment in Ultium Cells Holdings LLC\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\nGM investment in Cruise\n\n\n(0.5)\n\n\nInvestment in Lithium Americas\n\n\n(0.3)\n\n\nOther non-operating\n\n\n(0.1)\n\n\nIncrease in available credit facilities\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nTotal change in automotive available liquidity\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3.2)\n\n\nAutomotive Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n$\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.6\n\n\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment charges\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nPension and OPEB activities\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\n(2.4)\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nWorking capital\n\n\n(0.4)\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n(4.0)\n\n\n(0.9)\n\n\nAccrued and other liabilities and income taxes\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nOther(a)\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n(1.5)\n\n\nNet automotive cash provided by (used in) operating activities(b)\n\n\n$\n\n\n20.8\n\n\n$\n\n\n19.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $3.5 billion in dividends received from GM Financial in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, partially offset by non-cash changes in other assets and liabilities.\n\n\n(b)Includes $4.8 billion, $6.7 billion and $0.6 billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.

GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt.

Refer to the \"Automotive Liquidity\" section of this MD&A for additional details.\n\n\nCredit FacilitiesIn the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2023, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $27.0 billion, $0.8 billion and $2.0 billion with advances outstanding of $5.0 billion, an insignificant amount and $2.0 billion.\n\n\nGM Financial Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities(a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(10.9)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(10.0)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5.5)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.9)\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities(b)\n\n\n$\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.6)\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes $(3.0) billion, $(5.0) billion and $2.9 billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 for purchases of, and collections on, wholesale finance receivables and intercompany loans to GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n\n(b)Includes $(1.8) billion, $(1.7) billion and $(3.5) billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 for dividends to GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in finance charge income of $1.7 billion; (2) a net increase in cash provided by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities of $1.3 billion; (3) and a decrease in taxes paid to GM of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (4) an increase in interest paid of $2.0 billion and (5) a decrease in leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion.\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in purchases of leased vehicles of $1.7 billion; (2) a decrease in the proceeds from termination of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion partially offset by (3) an increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $1.3 billion; (4) and a decrease in purchases and originations of finance receivables of $0.5 billion.\n\n\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) a net increase in borrowings of $6.9 billion; partially offset by (2) an increase in debt repayments of $5.1 billion; and (3) an increase in dividend payments of $0.1 billion.\n\n\nLIBOR TransitionThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association launched its Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks Supplement and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which came into effect on January 25, 2021. The supplement incorporates fallbacks for new derivatives linked to LIBOR, and the protocol enables market participants to incorporate fallbacks for certain legacy derivatives linked to LIBOR. GM Financial adhered to the protocol prior to the June 30, 2023 cessation date and has transitioned all of its LIBOR-based derivative exposure. On March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act to address \"tough legacy\" contracts that lack adequate fallback provisions for determining a benchmark replacement to LIBOR. GM Financial expects to leverage the safe harbors and protections provided by the LIBOR Act and its implementing regulations to transition its limited LIBOR exposure remaining after the cessation date.\n\n\nCritical Accounting EstimatesThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall CampaignsThe estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\n\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\n\nSales IncentivesThe estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales\n\n\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nincentive liability by approximately $0.2 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan LossesThe GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.3 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.1 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending products to its dealer customers that include floorplan financing, also known as wholesale or inventory financing, which is lending to finance vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\n\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and ResidualsGM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.\n\n\nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.\n\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $22.7 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\n\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2023, which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n\nImpact to Depreciation Expense\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n158\n\n\n2025\n\n\n53\n\n\n2026\n\n\n15\n\n\n2027 and thereafter\n\n\n1\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n227\n\n\nChanges to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2023 or 2022.\n\n\nPension and OPEB PlansOur defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.\n\n\nIn December 2023, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result, the weighted-average long-term rate of ROA remains unchanged at 6.3% at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\n\n\nAnother key assumption in determining net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\n\nThe Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2023. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $5.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates and lower than expected asset returns.\n\n\nThe funded status of the U.S. pension plans deteriorated in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2.2 billion underfunded status from $0.1 billion overfunded status primarily due to: (1) service and interest costs of $2.4 billion; (2) the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of $1.3 billion; and (3) the unfavorable effect of plan amendments of $0.8 billion; partially offset by (4) the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $1.8 billion; and (5) contributions of $0.4 billion.\n\n\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:\n\n\nU.S. Plans(a)\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans(a)\n\n\nEffect on 2024 Pension  Expense\n\n\nEffect on December 31, 2023 PBO\n\n\nEffect on 2024 Pension  Expense\n\n\nEffect on December 31, 2023 PBO\n\n\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n\n\n-$58\n\n\n+$914\n\n\n-$5\n\n\n+$312\n\n\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n\n\n+$53\n\n\n-$872\n\n\n+$6\n\n\n-$299\n\n\n25 basis point decrease in expected rate of ROA\n\n\n+$109\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n+$25\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n25 basis point increase in expected rate of ROA\n\n\n-$109\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n-$25\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)The sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost.\n\n\nRefer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category.\n\n\nValuation of Deferred Tax AssetsThe ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were $7.0 billion. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and information on the $870 million income tax benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in Korea.\n\n\nNon-GAAP MeasuresWe use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.\n\n\nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.\n\n\nEBIT-adjusted(Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders)EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-\n\n\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nGAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted(Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share)EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\n\nETR-adjusted(Most comparable GAAP measure: Effective tax rate)ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\n\nROIC-adjusted(Most comparable GAAP measure: Return on equity)ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow(Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities)Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future events and are often identified by words like \"aim,\" \"anticipate,\" \"appears,\" \"approximately,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"designed,\" \"effect,\" \"estimate,\" \"evaluate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"goal,\" \"initiative,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"objective,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"priorities,\" \"project,\" \"pursue,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"when,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions. In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, include, among others, the following: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer needs and preferences; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of ICE vehicles, particularly our full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives, and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (6) the unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of AVs, including the various regulatory approvals and permits required for operating driverless AVs in multiple markets; (7) risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events; (8) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (9) inflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of raw materials and commodities used by us and our suppliers, and instability in logistics and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships, particularly with respect to facilitating access to raw materials necessary for the production of EVs, and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique political, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, including the risk of changes in government leadership and laws (including labor, trade, tax and other laws), political uncertainty or instability and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, economic downturns in the countries in which we operate, differing local product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions, differing labor regulations, requirements and union relationships, differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships, difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries, and public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises; (16) the\n\n\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\npossibility that competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (17) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (18) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the personal information of our customers, employees, or suppliers; (19) our ability to comply with extensive laws, regulations and policies applicable to our operations and products, including those relating to fuel economy, emissions and autonomous vehicles; (20) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (21) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (22) any additional tax expense or exposure or failure to fully realize available tax incentives; (23) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (24) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures.\n\n\nAutomotiveThe following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest rates, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.\n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2023, our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real. Derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2023 and were insignificant.\n\n\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation, transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nTranslation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n\n$\n\n\n(169)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(37)\n\n\nTransaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings\n\n\n$\n\n\n344\n\n\n$\n\n\n173\n\n\nInterest Rate RiskWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments, primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. At December 31, 2023, interest rate swap positions were used to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations and were insignificant. The fair value of debt and finance leases was $16.5 billion and $16.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.7 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nWe had marketable debt securities, including those held by Cruise, of $7.6 billion and $12.2 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial\n\n\nInterest Rate RiskFluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, repricing timing and prepayment expectations. Typically, retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM Financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\n\nQuantitative DisclosureGM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in GM Financial's analysis. Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent GM Financial's view of future interest rate movements.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within the next 12 months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its Global Asset Liability Committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.\n\n\nThe following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nOne hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates\n\n\n$\n\n\n(7.7)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(4.3)\n\n\nOne hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a)\n\n\n$\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.\n\n\nAdditional Model AssumptionsThe sensitivity analysis presented is GM Financial's best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios; however, actual results could differ. The estimates are also based on assumptions including\n\n\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nthe amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment projections are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.\n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate RiskGM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition.\n\n\nGM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used, GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2023 was insignificant.\n\n\nGM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $8.0 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes GM Financial's foreign currency translation, transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nTranslation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n\n$\n\n\n(147)\n\n\n$\n\n\n156\n\n\nTransaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings\n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\n$\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company\n\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\nProduct warranty and recall campaigns\n\n\nDescription of the matter\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall campaigns amount to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The Company accrues for costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\n\nAuditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's estimates due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities. Management's estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line, and the key assumptions of historical data being predictive of future activity and events, specifically the number of historical periods used and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies.\n\n\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\n\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's product warranty and recall campaign processes. We tested internal controls over management's review of the valuation models and significant assumptions for product warranty and recall, including the warranty claims forecasted based on the frequency and average cost per warranty claim for product warranty, and the cost estimates related to recall campaigns. Our audit also included the evaluation of controls that address the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized in the valuation models.\n\n\nOur audit procedures related to product warranty and recall campaigns also included, among others, evaluating the Company's estimation methodology, the related significant assumptions and underlying data, and performing analytical procedures to corroborate cost per vehicle based on historical claims data. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significant judgments made by management, including cost estimates to evaluate the impact on reserves from changes in assumptions. We performed analysis over the vehicle lines and model years that had little or no claims experience to ensure the vehicle and model substitutions are comparable. We also involved actuarial specialists to evaluate the methodologies and assumptions, and to test the actuarial calculations used by the Company.\n\n\nSales incentives\n\n\nDescription of the matter\n\n\nAutomotive sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, which is net of dealer and customer sales incentives the Company expects to pay. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, provisions for dealer and customer incentives are recorded as a reduction to Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sale. The liabilities for dealer and customer allowances, claims and discounts amount to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n\nAuditing the estimate of sales incentives involved a high degree of judgment. Significant factors used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. The Company's estimation model reflects the best estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of sale. The estimated cost of incentives is forward-looking, and could be materially affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\n\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\n\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's sales incentive process, including management's review of the estimation model, the significant assumptions (e.g., incentive cost per unit, customer take rate, and market conditions), and the data inputs used in the model.Our audit procedures included, among others, the performance of analytical procedures to develop an independent range of the liability for retail incentives as of the balance sheet date. Our independent range was developed for comparison to the Company's recorded liability, and is based on historical claims, forecasted spend, and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the cost per unit assumption developed by management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from a change in the assumption. Lastly, we assessed management's forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analyses to assess the adequacy of prior forecasts.\n\n\nValuation of GM Financial equipment on operating leases\n\n\nDescription of the matter\n\n\nGM Financial has recorded investments in vehicles leased to retail customers under operating leases. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, at the beginning of the lease, management establishes an expected residual value for each vehicle at the end of the lease term. The Company's estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease term was $22.7 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles involved a high degree of judgment. Management's estimate is based, in part, on third-party data which considers inputs including recent auction values and significant assumptions regarding the expected future volume of leased vehicles that will be returned to the Company, used car prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.\n\n\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\n\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the lease residual estimation process, including controls over management's review of residual value estimates obtained from the Company's third-party provider and other significant assumptions.Our procedures also included, among others, independently recalculating depreciation related to equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant assumptions. We also performed hindsight analyses to assess the propriety of management's estimate of residual values, as well as tested the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying systems and data warehouses that are used in the estimation models.\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n\n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND

1.Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\n\n\nGeneral Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Additionally, we are investing in and growing an AV business. We also provide automotive financing services through GM Financial. We analyze the results of our operations through the following segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\n\nPrinciples of ConsolidationWe consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate.\n\n\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial StatementsAccounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\n\n\nGM FinancialThe amounts presented for GM Financial are adjusted to reflect the impact on GM Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes resulting from the inclusion of GM Financial in our consolidated tax return and to eliminate the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\nNote 2.Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\nThe accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nAutomotiveAutomotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for vehicle, parts and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as maintenance, services and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from Automotive net sales and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the dealer are recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\n\nVehicle, Parts and AccessoriesFor the majority of vehicle and accessories sales, our customers obtain control and we recognize revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which typically occurs either when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer or upon delivery to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\n\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nTypically, transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales, with revenue recognized at the time of transfer. We defer revenue for remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts expected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\n\nUsed VehiclesProceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\n\nServices and OtherServices and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up toeight years.\n\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM FinancialFinance charge income earned on finance receivables is recognized using the effective interest method. Fees and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than60days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than60days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than90days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Gains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\n\nAdvertising and Promotion ExpendituresAdvertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.6billion, $4.0billion and $3.3billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nResearch and Development ExpendituresResearch and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.9billion, $9.8billion and $7.9billion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. We enter into co-development arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\n\nCash Equivalents and Restricted CashCash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturities of90days or less. Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nFair Value MeasurementsA three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 \u2013 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 \u2013 Quoted prices for similar instruments\n\n\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nin active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 \u2013 Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\n\nMarketable Debt SecuritiesWe generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Various factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\n\nAccounts and Notes ReceivableAccounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nGM Financial ReceivablesFinance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\n\nInventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\n\nEquipment on Operating LeasesEquipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms oftwotofive years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The estimate of the residual value is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset\n\n\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\ngroup. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations, when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed, the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.\n\n\nEquity InvestmentsWhen events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value or in certain cases adjusted to fair value upon an observable price change, with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\n\nProperty, netProperty, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\n\nSpecial ToolsSpecial tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\n\nGoodwillGoodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\n\nIntangible Assets, netIntangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of amortization over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of developed technology and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\n\nValuation of Long-Lived AssetsThe carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until disposition.\n\n\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nGovernment Incentives and GrantsWe receive incentives from federal, state and local governments in different regions of the world that primarily encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, employment, or production in the region. We are also entitled to certain advanced manufacturing production credits under the IRA. The benefit from both refundable and nonrefundable advanced manufacturing production credits are not accounted for or classified as an income tax credit. We account for government incentives as a reduction of expense, a reduction of the cost of the capital investment or other income based on the substance of the incentive received. Benefits are generally recorded when there is reasonable assurance of receipt or, as it relates to advance manufacturing production credits, upon the generation of the credit. Amounts are recorded in earnings as the expenses in which the incentive is meant to offset are incurred, as we meet the conditions of the grant or as the capital investment is depreciated or, as it relates to advance manufacturing production credits, upon generation of the credit.At December 31, 2023, cash incentives in Cash and cash equivalents was $717million, cash incentives receivable in Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowance was $190million, cash incentives credited to Property, net was $480million, cash incentives receivable in Other assets was $269million and deferred incentive income in Other liabilities was $341million. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $251million in Automotive and other cost of sales associated with incentives. Current agreements expire at various dates through 2031 and we consider the risk that any amounts recognized will be returned to be remote.\n\n\nPension and OPEB Plans\n\n\nAttribution, Methods and AssumptionsThe cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific to the plan, the expected future working lifetime or the life expectancy of the plan participants.\n\n\nThe cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life expectancy of the plan participants.\n\n\nAn expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets over a period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes60% of the difference between the fair value of assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and10% of that difference over each of the nextfour years.\n\n\nThe discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates. In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high-quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\n\nThe benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany represents90% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2023. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach like the U.S.\n\n\nPlan Asset ValuationDue to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had timely available market information been available.\n\n\nCommon and Preferred StockCommon and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued securities or other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider aged (stale) pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\n\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nDebt SecuritiesValuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.\n\n\nInvestment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate InvestmentsInvestment funds, private equity and debt investments and real estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices.\n\n\nNAVs are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date. In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.\n\n\nStock Incentive PlansOur stock incentive plans include RSUs, PSUs, stock options and awards that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined utilizing the Black-Scholes formula or a lattice model, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for service-based RSUs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. In March 2022, all outstanding RSUs that settle in Cruise's common stock were modified to remove the liquidity vesting condition. Prospectively,RSUs that will settle in Cruise's common stock will vest solely upon satisfaction of a service condition.Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has been established, or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting period. Compensation cost is also recorded on stock issued to settle awards based on the fair value of Cruise's common stock until such time that the stock has been issued for more than six months.\n\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall CampaignsThe estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.\n\n\nThe estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related to recall campaigns by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using the estimated costs of repairs and the estimated number of vehicles to be repaired. Costs associated with recall campaigns are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\n\nIncome TaxesThe liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law. We record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred. Income tax effects are released from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific-identification method.\n\n\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nWe establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rollingthree yearsof actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\n\n\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense.\n\n\nForeign Currency Transactions and TranslationThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\n\nGains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.Foreign currency transactions and remeasurements in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were losses of $349million, losses of $172million and insignificant gains.\n\n\nDerivative Financial InstrumentsDerivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of each derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as an accounting hedge, as well as the type of hedging relationship identified. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are typically classified in cash flows from operating activities. Derivative instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n\nAutomotiveWe utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risks. The change in the fair value of option, swap and forward contracts not designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\n\nCertain foreign currency and commodity forward contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The risks being hedged are foreign currency and commodity price risks related to forecasted transactions. The change in the fair value of these forward contracts is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue or Automotive and other cost of sales when the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and throughout the hedge period.\n\n\nCertain receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swap agreements have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate debt. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The changes in both the fair value of the hedged debt and the hedging instrument are recorded in Automotive interest expense. When a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated prior to maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized in Automotive interest expense over its remaining life.\n\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM FinancialGM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\n\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\n\nNote 3.Revenue\n\n\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source for revenue generating segments:\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n\n\nGMNA\n\n\nGMI\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nTotal Automotive\n\n\nCruise\n\n\nGM Financial\n\n\nEliminations/ Reclassifications\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nVehicle, parts and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n136,983\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,424\n\n\n$\n\n\n113\n\n\n$\n\n\n151,520\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n$\n\n\n151,510\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n954\n\n\n37\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n991\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n991\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n3,508\n\n\n1,487\n\n\n160\n\n\n5,155\n\n\n102\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n5,157\n\n\nAutomotive net sales and revenue\n\n\n141,445\n\n\n15,949\n\n\n273\n\n\n157,667\n\n\n102\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(110)\n\n\n157,658\n\n\nLeased vehicle income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n7,266\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n7,266\n\n\nFinance charge income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n6,204\n\n\n(18)\n\n\n6,187\n\n\nOther income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n754\n\n\n(23)\n\n\n732\n\n\nGM Financial net sales and revenue\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n14,225\n\n\n(41)\n\n\n14,184\n\n\nNet sales and revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n141,445\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,949\n\n\n$\n\n\n273\n\n\n$\n\n\n157,667\n\n\n$\n\n\n102\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,225\n\n\n$\n\n\n(151)\n\n\n$\n\n\n171,842\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n\n\nGMNA\n\n\nGMI\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nTotal Automotive\n\n\nCruise\n\n\nGM Financial\n\n\nEliminations/ Reclassifications\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nVehicle, parts and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n124,657\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,993\n\n\n$\n\n\n42\n\n\n$\n\n\n138,692\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n138,692\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n483\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n516\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n516\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n3,238\n\n\n1,393\n\n\n134\n\n\n4,765\n\n\n102\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(101)\n\n\n4,766\n\n\nAutomotive net sales and revenue\n\n\n128,378\n\n\n15,420\n\n\n177\n\n\n143,974\n\n\n102\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(101)\n\n\n143,975\n\n\nLeased vehicle income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n7,811\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n7,811\n\n\nFinance charge income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,521\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n4,519\n\n\nOther income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n435\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n431\n\n\nGM Financial net sales and revenue\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n12,766\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n12,760\n\n\nNet sales and revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n128,378\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,420\n\n\n$\n\n\n177\n\n\n$\n\n\n143,974\n\n\n$\n\n\n102\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,766\n\n\n$\n\n\n(107)\n\n\n$\n\n\n156,735\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\n\n\nGMNA\n\n\nGMI\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nTotal Automotive\n\n\nCruise\n\n\nGM Financial\n\n\nEliminations/ Reclassifications\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nVehicle, parts and accessories\n\n\n$\n\n\n97,515\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,956\n\n\n$\n\n\n14\n\n\n$\n\n\n108,485\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n108,485\n\n\nUsed vehicles\n\n\n545\n\n\n49\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n594\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n594\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n3,248\n\n\n1,167\n\n\n90\n\n\n4,505\n\n\n106\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n4,511\n\n\nAutomotive net sales and revenue\n\n\n101,308\n\n\n12,172\n\n\n104\n\n\n113,584\n\n\n106\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n113,590\n\n\nLeased vehicle income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,026\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,026\n\n\nFinance charge income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,103\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,103\n\n\nOther income\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n290\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n285\n\n\nGM Financial net sales and revenue\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n13,419\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n13,414\n\n\nNet sales and revenue\n\n\n$\n\n\n101,308\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,172\n\n\n$\n\n\n104\n\n\n$\n\n\n113,584\n\n\n$\n\n\n106\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,419\n\n\n$\n\n\n(105)\n\n\n$\n\n\n127,004\n\n\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.

For dealer financing, proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each dealer.

The debt issued by these VIEs is backed by finance receivables and leasing-related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities.

The benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service and compensation history. Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased in 2012 for U.S. and Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded nonqualified pension plan primarily covering U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an \"excess plan\" for service after that date.\n\n\nThe funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable laws and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2023, all legal funding requirements were met.The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nU.S. hourly and salaried\n\n\n$\n\n\n357\n\n\n$\n\n\n71\n\n\n$\n\n\n67\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n395\n\n\n332\n\n\n371\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n753\n\n\n$\n\n\n403\n\n\n$\n\n\n438\n\n\nWe expect to make insignificant contributions to our U.S. pension plans and up to $700million in contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2024.\n\n\nOther Postretirement Benefit PlansCertain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental, legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $295million, $335million and $351million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nDefined Contribution PlansWe have defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide discretionary matching contributions.

The U.S. study includes a review of alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance and risk of the individual asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical returns, the expected rate of return on plan assets represents our estimate of long-term prospective rates of return.\n\n\nWe continue to pursue various options to fund and to manage risk in our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset portfolio mix to manage funded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently, there are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each plan.\n\n\nIn setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively fund the projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S. defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded status.\n\n\nDerivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate, equity and currency risks. Equity and fixed income managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy and equity derivatives may be used to protect equity positions from downside market losses. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.\n\n\nIn December 2023, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result, the weighted-average long-term rate of ROA remains unchanged at6.3% at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\n\n\nTarget Allocation PercentagesThe following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans:\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\nEquity\n\n\n11\n\n\n%\n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n8\n\n\n%\n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\nDebt\n\n\n60\n\n\n%\n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\n69\n\n\n%\n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\nOther(a)\n\n\n29\n\n\n%\n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n23\n\n\n%\n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)    Primarily includes private equity, real estate and absolute return strategies, which mainly consist of hedge funds.\n\n\n84\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nAssets and Fair Value MeasurementsThe following tables summarize the fair value of U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets by asset class:\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\nLevel 3\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\nLevel 3\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nU.S. Pension Plan Assets\n\n\nCommon and preferred stocks\n\n\n$\n\n\n850\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n850\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,222\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n3\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,225\n\n\nGovernment and agency debt securities(a)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,822\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,822\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,606\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n9,606\n\n\nCorporate and other debt securities\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n20,957\n\n\n3\n\n\n20,960\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n21,816\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n21,816\n\n\nOther investments, net(b)\n\n\n545\n\n\n(269)\n\n\n328\n\n\n604\n\n\n125\n\n\n60\n\n\n254\n\n\n439\n\n\nNet plan assets subject to leveling\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,395\n\n\n$\n\n\n30,510\n\n\n$\n\n\n331\n\n\n32,236\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,347\n\n\n$\n\n\n31,482\n\n\n$\n\n\n257\n\n\n33,086\n\n\nPlan assets measured at net asset value\n\n\nInvestment funds\n\n\n5,322\n\n\n5,124\n\n\nPrivate equity and debt investments\n\n\n2,864\n\n\n3,936\n\n\nReal estate investments\n\n\n2,976\n\n\n3,491\n\n\nTotal plan assets measured at net asset value\n\n\n11,162\n\n\n12,551\n\n\nOther plan assets (liabilities), net(c)\n\n\n(1,111)\n\n\n(736)\n\n\nNet plan assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n42,287\n\n\n$\n\n\n44,901\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\nLevel 3\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\nLevel 3\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nNon-U.S. Pension Plan Assets\n\n\nCommon and preferred stocks\n\n\n$\n\n\n160\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n160\n\n\n$\n\n\n143\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n143\n\n\nGovernment and agency debt securities(a)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,310\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,310\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,185\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,185\n\n\nCorporate and other debt securities\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,738\n\n\n7\n\n\n2,745\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2,570\n\n\n1\n\n\n2,571\n\n\nOther investments, net(b)(d)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(55)\n\n\n43\n\n\n(16)\n\n\n24\n\n\n(70)\n\n\n84\n\n\n38\n\n\nNet plan assets subject to leveling\n\n\n$\n\n\n156\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,993\n\n\n$\n\n\n50\n\n\n5,199\n\n\n$\n\n\n167\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,685\n\n\n$\n\n\n85\n\n\n4,937\n\n\nPlan assets measured at net asset value\n\n\nInvestment funds\n\n\n3,265\n\n\n3,124\n\n\nPrivate equity and debt investments\n\n\n431\n\n\n483\n\n\nReal estate investments\n\n\n781\n\n\n878\n\n\nTotal plan assets measured at net asset value\n\n\n4,477\n\n\n4,485\n\n\nOther plan assets (liabilities), net(c)\n\n\n143\n\n\n108\n\n\nNet plan assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,819\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,530\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)Includes U.S. and sovereign government and agency issues.\n\n\n(b)Includes net derivative assets (liabilities).\n\n\n(c)Cash held by the plans, net of amounts receivable/payable for unsettled security transactions and payables for investment manager fees, custody fees and other expenses.\n\n\n(d)Level 2 Other investments, net includes Canadian repurchase agreements of approximately $137million and $150million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nThe activity attributable to U.S. and non-U.S. Level 3 defined benefit pension plan investments was insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\nInvestment Fund StrategiesInvestment funds include hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, equity funds and fixed income funds. Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array of funds and/or investment managers. Equity funds invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed income funds include investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income\n\n\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nfunds invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed income funds invest in high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations, which are rated below investment grade. Other investment funds also included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy funds that invest in broadly diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and derivative instruments.\n\n\nPrivate equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and distressed debt strategies.\n\n\nReal estate investments include funds that invest in entities that are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development, financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds.\n\n\nSignificant Concentrations of RiskThe assets of the pension plans include certain investment funds, private equity and debt investments and real estate investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.\n\n\nIlliquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market liquidity events.\n\n\nThe pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.\n\n\nThe pension plans may invest in debt securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition, changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate risk.\n\n\nBenefit PaymentsBenefits for most U.S. pension plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans are paid out of plan assets rather than our Cash and cash equivalents.The following table summarizes net benefit payments expected to be paid in the future, which include assumptions related to estimated future employee service:\n\n\nPension Benefits\n\n\nGlobal OPEB Plans\n\n\nU.S. Plans\n\n\nNon-U.S. Plans\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,405\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,071\n\n\n$\n\n\n365\n\n\n2025\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,213\n\n\n$\n\n\n955\n\n\n$\n\n\n361\n\n\n2026\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,110\n\n\n$\n\n\n929\n\n\n$\n\n\n357\n\n\n2027\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,995\n\n\n$\n\n\n909\n\n\n$\n\n\n353\n\n\n2028\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,846\n\n\n$\n\n\n892\n\n\n$\n\n\n350\n\n\n2029\u20132033\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,966\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,225\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,699\n\n\nNote 16.Commitments and Contingencies\n\n\nLitigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative MattersIn the normal course of our business, we are named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation. We identify below the material individual proceedings and investigations where we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. We accrue for matters when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had accruals of $1.2billion and $1.1billion in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss.\n\n\n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nSome matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, while we believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, it is possible that adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.\n\n\nGM Korea Subcontract Workers LitigationGM Korea Company (GM Korea) is party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers over allegations that they are entitled to the same wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time employees. In May 2018 and September 2020, the Korean labor authorities issued adverse administrative orders finding that GM Korea must hire certain current subcontract workers as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed the May 2018 and September 2020 orders. Since June 2020, the Seoul High Court (an intermediate-level appellate court) ruled against GM Korea ineightsubcontract worker claims. Although GM Korea has appealed these decisions to the Korea Supreme Court, GM Korea has since hired certain of its subcontract workers as full-time employees. At December 31, 2023, our accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we believe are probable of assertion and for which liability is probable was approximately $147million. We estimate the reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for other current subcontract workers who may assert similar claims to be approximately $86million at December 31, 2023. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from additional claims that may be asserted by former subcontract workers.\n\n\nOther Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative MattersVarious other legal actions, including class actions, governmental investigations, claims and proceedings are pending against us or our related companies or joint ventures, including, but not limited to, matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; product and workplace safety, vehicle emissions and fuel economy regulations; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to the provision of Accounting Standards Codification 740, \"Income Taxes\" (indirect tax-related matters); product design, manufacture and performance; consumer protection laws; and environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental remediation from stationary sources. We also from time to time receive subpoenas and other inquiries or requests for information from agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and foreign governments on a variety of issues.\n\n\nThere are several putative class actions pending against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that various vehicles sold, including model year 2011\u20132016 Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles, violate federal, state and foreign emission standards. In July 2023, the putative class actions pending in the U.S. were dismissed with prejudice and judgment entered in favor of GM, and plaintiffs appealed the dismissal. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits in the U.S. based on these allegations, including a shareholder demand lawsuit that remains pending.\n\n\nThere are several putative class actions andtwocertified class actions pending against GM in the U.S. alleging that various 2011\u20132014 model year vehicles are defective because they excessively consume oil. While many of these proceedings have been dismissed or have been settled for insignificant amounts, several remain outstanding, and in October 2022, we received an adverse jury verdict in a certified class action proceeding involving three states. We do not believe that the verdict is supported by the evidence and plan to appeal. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from the putative class action proceedings and have previously accrued an immaterial amount related to one of the certified class action proceedings.\n\n\nThere isoneputative class action andonecertified class action pending against GM in the U.S. alleging that various 2015\u20132022 model year vehicles are defective because they are equipped with faulty 8-speed transmissions. In March 2023, the judge overseeing the class action concerning 2015\u20132019 model year vehicles certified 26 state subclasses. The Sixth Circuit has agreed to hear our appeal of this class certification order. The putative class action concerning 2020\u20132022 model year vehicles is pending in front of a different judge that has not yet addressed class certification. We have similar cases pending in Canada concerning these vehicles. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued an insignificant amount in connection with these matters. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings in excess of amounts accrued.\n\n\nThere is a class action pending against GM in the U.S., and a putative class action in Canada, alleging that 2011\u20132016 model year Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles are equipped with defective fuel pumps that are prone to\n\n\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nfailure. In March 2023, the U.S. court certified seven state subclasses. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued an insignificant amount in connection with these matters. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings in excess of amounts accrued.\n\n\nBeyond the class action litigations disclosed, we have several other class action litigations pending at any given time. Historically, relatively few classes have been certified in these types of cases. Therefore, we will generally only disclose specific class actions if a class is certified and we believe there is a reasonably possible material exposure to the Company.\n\n\nWe are currently in discussions with the EPA and other regulators regarding potential adjustments to certain prior year GHG and CAFE accounting balances. Based on progress made in these discussions, in the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued $289million. Through December 31, 2023, the total costs expensed in connection with these matters were $450million, which represents our current best estimate of the probable loss related to these matters. We are currently unable to provide an estimate of any loss in excess of amounts incurred, but such loss may be material.\n\n\nIndirect tax-related matters are being evaluated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales tax, property taxes and other non-income tax-related tax exposures. Certain administrative proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security. For indirect tax-related matters, we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be up to approximately $1.9billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n\nTakata MattersIn November 2020, NHTSA directed that we replace the Takata Corporation (Takata) airbag inflators in our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, and we decided not to contest NHTSA's decision. While we have already begun the process of executing the recall, given the number of vehicles in this population, the recall will take several years to be completed. Accordingly, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a warranty accrual of $1.1billion for the expected costs of complying with the recall remedy. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we reduced our accrual by an insignificant amount based on the actual costs incurred to-date. At December 31, 2023, our remaining accrual for these matters was $609million, and we believe the currently accrued amount remains reasonable.\n\n\nGM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Any additional recalls relating to these inflators could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nThere are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are defective. In March 2023, a U.S. court overseeingoneof the putative class actions issued a final judgment in favor of GM on all claims in eight states at issue in that proceeding. Plaintiffs have appealed this decision. In August 2023, the U.S. court granted class certification as to a Louisiana claim, but denied certification as to seven other states. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss.\n\n\nARC MattersIn May 2023, we initiated a voluntary recall covering nearlyone million2014\u20132017 model year Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia SUVs equipped with driver front airbag inflators manufactured by ARC Automotive, Inc. (ARC), and accrued an insignificant amount for the expected costs of the recall. As part of its ongoing investigation into ARC airbag inflators, on September 5, 2023, NHTSA issued an initial decision that approximately52million frontal driver and passenger airbag inflators manufactured by ARC and Delphi Automotive Systems LLC over a roughly20-yearperiod contain a safety-related defect and must be recalled. NHTSA's initial decision is based on the occurrence of seven field ruptures involving ARC-manufactured frontal airbag inflators. We are continuing to investigate the cause of the ruptures in GM vehicles in connection with our existing recalls. The administrative record for NHTSA's investigation closed on December 18, 2023, and we are waiting for NHTSA to issue its final decision. As indicated in GM's filed comment in the record, we do not believe that further GM vehicle recalls are necessary or appropriate at this time. However, depending on the outcome of the dispute between NHTSA and ARC, and the possibility of additional recalls, the cost of which may not be fully recoverable, it is reasonably possible that the costs associated with these matters in excess of amounts accrued could be material, but we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss at this time.\n\n\nThere are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the U.S., Canada and Israel, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by ARC are defective. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss.\n\n\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nChevrolet Bolt RecallIn July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017\u20132019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs due to the risk thattwomanufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these vehicles. After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG Energy Solution (LGES), and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017\u20132022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility Vehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and LGES (collectively, LG), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, through December 31, 2023, we have accrued a total of $2.6billion and recognized receivables totaling $1.6billion in connection with these matters. At December 31, 2023, our remaining accrual for these matters was $0.6billion. These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower.\n\n\nIn addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EVs and EUVs included in the recall population are defective. GM has reached an agreement in principle to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount.\n\n\nOpel/Vauxhall SaleIn 2017, we sold the Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group (now Stellantis) under a Master Agreement (the Agreement). We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.\n\n\nCurrently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, we indemnified Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.\n\n\nProduct LiabilityWe recorded liabilities of $615million and $561million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It is reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. We believe that any judgment against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage.\n\n\nGuaranteesWe enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2024 to 2028, or upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on royalties received associated with vehicles sold to date were $3.5billion and $3.1billion for these guarantees at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements.\n\n\nWe provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances, certain assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car companies.\n\n\n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nWe periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant. Refer to the Opel/Vauxhall Sale section of this note for additional information on our indemnification obligations to Stellantis under the Agreement.\n\n\nCredit CardsCredit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $384million and $353million, and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.2billion and $1.1billion. Our redemption liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.\n\n\nSupplier Finance ProgramsThird-party finance providers offer certain suppliers the option for payment in advance of their invoice due date through financing programs that we established. We retain our obligation to the participating suppliers, and we make payments directly to the third-party finance providers on the original invoice due date pursuant to the original invoice terms. There are no assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided for committed payments. Our outstanding eligible balances under our supplier finance programs were $1.3billion and $852million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which are recorded inAccounts payable(principally trade).\n\n\nNote 17.Income Taxes\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nU.S. income (loss)\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,388\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,454\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,513\n\n\nNon-U.S. income (loss)\n\n\n3,535\n\n\n1,306\n\n\n1,902\n\n\nIncome (loss) before income taxes and equity income (loss)\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,924\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,760\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,415\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCurrent income tax expense (benefit)\n\n\nU.S. federal\n\n\n$\n\n\n240\n\n\n$\n\n\n389\n\n\n$\n\n\n20\n\n\nU.S. state and local\n\n\n490\n\n\n368\n\n\n142\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n874\n\n\n707\n\n\n395\n\n\nTotal current income tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n1,605\n\n\n1,464\n\n\n557\n\n\nDeferred income tax expense (benefit)\n\n\nU.S. federal\n\n\n(120)\n\n\n263\n\n\n1,699\n\n\nU.S. state and local\n\n\n(43)\n\n\n109\n\n\n229\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\n\n(878)\n\n\n53\n\n\n286\n\n\nTotal deferred income tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n(1,041)\n\n\n425\n\n\n2,214\n\n\nTotal income tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n$\n\n\n563\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,888\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,771\n\n\nThe Non-U.S. deferred income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2023 relates primarily to the release of a valuation allowance in Korea.\n\n\nProvisions are made for estimated U.S. and non-U.S. income taxes which may be incurred on the reversal of our basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.

Accordingly, we released Korea's $870million valuation allowance resulting in an income tax benefit.\n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $7.0billion and $7.7billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany, Spain, the U.S. and Brazil.\n\n\nUncertain Tax PositionsThe following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n520\n\n\n$\n\n\n634\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,086\n\n\nAdditions to current year tax positions\n\n\n45\n\n\n12\n\n\n22\n\n\nAdditions to prior years' tax positions\n\n\n72\n\n\n14\n\n\n46\n\n\nReductions to prior years' tax positions\n\n\n(15)\n\n\n(98)\n\n\n(473)\n\n\nReductions in tax positions due to lapse of statutory limitations\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n(17)\n\n\nSettlements\n\n\n(18)\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n(26)\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n585\n\n\n$\n\n\n520\n\n\n$\n\n\n634\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $386million and $356million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, income tax related interest and penalties were insignificant. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, liabilities for income tax related interest and penalties were insignificant.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.\n\n\nOther MattersIncome tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have open tax years from 2011 to 2023 with various significant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given audit cycle.\n\n\nNote 18.Restructuring and Other Initiatives\n\n\nWe have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we may execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary, to streamline manufacturing capacity and reduce other costs to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements, a liability is recorded once the amount is probable and reasonably estimable. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense.\n\n\n92\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment benefit reserves and charges:\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nBalance at beginning of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n520\n\n\n$\n\n\n285\n\n\n$\n\n\n352\n\n\nAdditions, interest accretion and other\n\n\n1,831\n\n\n522\n\n\n216\n\n\nPayments\n\n\n(1,597)\n\n\n(275)\n\n\n(278)\n\n\nRevisions to estimates and effect of foreign currency\n\n\n25\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n779\n\n\n$\n\n\n520\n\n\n$\n\n\n285\n\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, restructuring and other initiatives included strategic activities in GMNA related to Buick dealerships. We recorded charges of $569million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the table above, and incurred $674million in net cash outflows resulting from these dealer restructurings, in addition to the charges of $511million and net cash outflows of $120million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The remaining $286million is expected to be paid by the end of 2024.\n\n\nIn March 2023, we announced a VSP to accelerate attrition related to the cost reduction program announced in January 2023. We recorded charges in GMNA of $1.0billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to employee separation charges of $905million, which are reflected in the table above, and non-cash pension curtailment and settlement charges of approximately $130million, not reflected in the table above. We incurred $820million of cash outflows resulting from the VSP. We expect remaining cash outflows related to these activities of approximately $85million to be complete during 2024.\n\n\nIn October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV operations in the U.S. while it examines its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529million in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to supplier related charges of $212million and employee separation charges of $67million, both of which are included in the table above. Additionally, Cruise recorded non-cash restructuring charges of $250million primarily related to impairments, which are not reflected in the table above. We expect the associated cashflows related to these activities to be substantially complete by the end of 2024. At December 31, 2023, the net book value of Cruise's long-lived assets, inclusive of goodwill and intangibles, was $1.4billion which may be subject to future impairments depending on future progress toward commercialization of the Cruise AV operations.\n\n\nNote 19.Interest Income and Other Non-Operating Income\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nNon-service pension and OPEB income (loss)\n\n\n$\n\n\n184\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,512\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,909\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n1,109\n\n\n460\n\n\n146\n\n\nLicensing agreements income\n\n\n172\n\n\n238\n\n\n195\n\n\nRevaluation of investments\n\n\n(77)\n\n\n(236)\n\n\n571\n\n\nOther\n\n\n149\n\n\n(542)\n\n\n220\n\n\nTotal interest income and other non-operating income, net\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,537\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,432\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,041\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we shut down our Russia business and recorded a $657million charge, included in Other in the table above, to write off our net investment and release accumulated translation losses into earnings.\n\n\nNote 20.Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests\n\n\nWe have2.0billion shares of preferred stock and5.0billion shares of common stock authorized for issuance.

Our dividends declared per common share were $0.36and $0.18and our total dividends paid on common stock were $477million and $257million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Dividends were not declared or paid on our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2021. Holders of common stock are entitled toonevote per share on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote. The liquidation rights of holders of our common stock are secondary to the payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our preferred stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.\n\n\nIn November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our share repurchase program by $10.0billion to an aggregate of $11.4billion and we entered into the ASR Agreements to repurchase an aggregate amount of $10.0billion of our common stock under the authorized share repurchase program. On December 1, 2023, we advanced the $10.0billion and received approximately215million shares of our common stock with a value of $6.8billion, which were immediately retired. The final number of shares to ultimately be purchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Upon final settlement, we may receive additional shares of common stock, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment, at our election. The final settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements is scheduled to occur no later than the three months ending December 31, 2024. Because of our ability to settle in shares, the $3.2billion prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital within the consolidated statement of equity.\n\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased approximately245million shares of our outstanding common stock for $7.9billion, including the initial delivery under the ASR Agreements of approximately215million shares at a value of $6.8billion. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased approximately64million shares of our outstanding common stock for $2.5billion. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we didnot purchase any shares of our outstanding common stock. Shares are immediately retired upon purchase and the amount of the purchase price over par is allocated on a pro-rata basis, subject to the availability of paid-in capital calculated on a per-share basis, between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings.\n\n\nCruise Preferred SharesIn 2021, Cruise Holdings issued $2.7billion of Class G Preferred Shares (Cruise Class G Preferred Shares) to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and other investors, including $1.0billion to General Motors Holdings LLC. All proceeds related to the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of Cruise Holdings. In addition, we, Cruise Holdings and Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles with Microsoft being the preferred public cloud provider.\n\n\nThe Cruise Class G Preferred Shares participate pari passu with holders of Cruise Holdings common stock and Class F Preferred Shares (Cruise Class F Preferred Shares) in any dividends declared. The Cruise Class G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares convert into the class of shares to be issued to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) at specified exchange ratios. No covenants or other events of default exist that can trigger redemption of the Cruise Class G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares. The Cruise Class G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares are entitled to receive the greater of their carrying value or a pro-rata share of any proceeds or distributions upon the occurrence of a merger, sale, liquidation or dissolution of Cruise Holdings, and are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nIn March 2022, under the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired SoftBank's Cruise Class A-1, Class F and Class G Preferred Shares for $2.1billion and made an additional $1.35billion investment in Cruise in place of SoftBank. SoftBank no longer has an ownership interest in or has any rights with respect to Cruise.\n\n\nCruise Common SharesDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cruise Holdings issued approximately $0.4billion and $0.8billion of Class B Common Shares to net settle vested awards under Cruise's 2018 Employee Incentive Plan and issued approximately $0.2billion and $0.5billion of Class B Common Shares, primarily to us, to fund the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations resulting from the settlement or exercise of vested awards. GM conducted quarterly tender offers and paid approximately $0.3billion and $0.6billion in cash to purchase tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Class B Common Shares are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements except for certain shares that are liability classified that have a recorded value of approximately $42million and $60million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The 2020 LTIP was approved by stockholders in June 2020. Any new awards granted after the approval of the 2020 LTIP in June 2020 will be issued under the 2020 LTIP. To the extent any shares remain available for issuance under the 2017 LTIP and/or the 2014 LTIP, such shares will only be used to settle outstanding awards that were previously granted under such plans prior to June 2020. Shares awarded under the plans are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability.\n\n\nRSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over athree-yearservice period, as defined in the terms of each award. PSU awards vest at the end of athree-yearperformance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options expire10years from the grant date. Our performance-based stock options vest ratably over55months based on the performance of our common stock relative to that of a specified peer group. Our service-based stock options vest ratably overthree years.\n\n\n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nShares (in millions)\n\n\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n\n\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term in Years\n\n\nUnits outstanding at January 1, 2023\n\n\n34.1\n\n\n$\n\n\n27.62\n\n\n0.8\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n$\n\n\n33.54\n\n\nSettled\n\n\n(5.8)\n\n\n$\n\n\n38.66\n\n\nForfeited or expired\n\n\n(2.7)\n\n\n$\n\n\n36.55\n\n\nUnits outstanding at December 31, 2023(a)\n\n\n39.9\n\n\n$\n\n\n27.53\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n__________\n\n\n(a)     Includes the target amount of PSUs.\n\n\nOur weighted-average assumptions used to value our stock options are a dividend yield of1.90%,1.60% and1.67%, expected volatility of34.0%,41.0% and47.8%, a risk-free interest rate of3.70%,1.88% and0.76%, and an expected option life of6.00years for options issued during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock.\n\n\nTotal compensation expense related to the above awards was $340million, $419million and $391million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested equity awards granted was $249million. This expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of1.4years. The total fair value of stock incentive awards vested was $425million, $307million and $258million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n\nCruise Stock Incentive AwardsCruise granted RSUs that will settle in common shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Stock options were granted in common shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These awards were granted under Cruise's 2018 Employee Incentive Plan approved by Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors in August 2018. Shares awarded under the plan are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plan. In March 2022, Cruise modified its RSUs that settle in Cruise Class B Common Shares to remove the liquidity vesting condition such that all granted RSU awards vest solely upon satisfaction of a service condition. The service condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied overfour years. Upon modification,31million RSUs whose service condition was previously met became immediately vested, thereby resulting in the immediate recognition of compensation expense. Subsequent to the modification, holders of Cruise Class B Common Shares issued to settle vested awards could tender their shares generally at the fair value of Cruise's common stock. The ability to tender the Class B Common Shares results in certain awards to be classified as liabilities and other awards to be presented in temporary equity. Stock options vest ratably overfourto10years, as defined in the terms of each award. Stock options expire up to10years from the grant date. During the year ended December 31, 2023,14.6million stock options were forfeited. At December 31, 2023,9.8million equity classified vested stock options with a2.8year weighted-average remaining contractual term are outstanding.\n\n\nTotal compensation expense related to Cruise Holdings' share-based awards was $0.4billion, $1.6billion and an insignificant amount for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, when excluding the compensation expense for the period April 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, primarily represents the impact of the modification to outstanding awards. GM conducted quarterly tender offers and paid approximately $0.3billion and $0.6billion in cash to settle tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.Nocash was paid to settle share-based awards for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Total unrecognized compensation expense for Cruise Holdings' nonvested share-based awards granted was $0.7billion at December 31, 2023. The expense related to share-based awards is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of2.9years.\n\n\nNote 23.Segment Reporting\n\n\nWe analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. The chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and\n\n\n97\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 (Continued)\n\n\nmeasuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting required fuel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.\n\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\n\nOur management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2023, utilizing the criteria discussed in the \"Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited byErnst & Young LLP(PCAOB ID:42), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n\n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIESNone.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *Not applicable.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14\n\n\nInformation required by Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this Form 10-K is incorporated by reference from our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will be filed with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation 14A, not later than 120 days after the end of the 2023 fiscal year, all of which information is hereby incorporated by reference in, and made part of, this Form 10-K, except disclosure of our executive officers, which is included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n\n102\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(a)1.

The discussion of such risks is not an indication that any such risks have occurred at the time of this filing. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\n\nTable of ContentsOverview\n\n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\n\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\n\n\nSegment Information\n\n\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n\n\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\n\nOur Products and Services\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles \u2013 the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (\"SUV\") built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\n\n\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (\"FSD\") Capability features, battery cell and other technologies.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nEnergy Storage Products\n\n\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (\"GWh\") or greater capacity.\n\n\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n\n\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nSolar Energy Offerings\n\n\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\n\n\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on new homes.\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nBattery and Powertrain\n\n\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\n\n\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\n\n\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\n\n\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles' software regularly through over-the-air updates.\n\n\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\n\n\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\n\n\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\n\n\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve.\n\n\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n\n\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nEnergy Storage Products\n\n\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\n\n\nSolar Energy Systems\n\n\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\n\n\nDesign and Engineering\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\n\n\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n\n\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as necessary.\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nDirect Sales\n\n\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\n\n\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nUsed Vehicle Sales\n\n\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer's existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\n\n\nPublic Charging\n\n\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate\u2014which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\n\n\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\n\n\nIn-App Upgrades\n\n\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\n\n\nService and Warranty\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nService\n\n\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers' homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.\n\n\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\n\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\n\n\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer's limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship.\n\n\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers' warranties.\n\n\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract.\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nPurchase Financing and Leases\n\n\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nWe offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas, Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\n\n\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing.\n\n\nSupply Chain\n\n\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\n\n\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\n\n\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\n\n\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\n\n\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\n\n\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n\nPrograms and Incentives\n\n\nInflation Reduction Act\n\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\"IRA\") was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\n\n\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\n\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (\"ZEVs\"), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\n\n\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\n\n\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\n\n\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\n\n\nRegulations\n\n\nVehicle Safety and Testing\n\n\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\"), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (\"FMVSS\") and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\n\n\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer's suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\"), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\n\n\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features.\n\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\n\n\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\n\n\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"ECE markets\"), some requirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\n\n\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S. and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\n\n\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\n\n\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer's ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened \"galleries\" that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\n\n\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\n\n\nBattery Safety and Testing\n\n\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of \"dangerous goods,\" defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\n\n\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\n\n\nSolar Energy\u2014General\n\n\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\n\n\nSolar Energy\u2014Net Metering\n\n\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the electric vehicle market.\n\n\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\n\n\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nEnergy Storage Systems\n\n\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\n\n\nSolar Energy Systems\n\n\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\n\n\nESG\n\n\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\n\n\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\n\n\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board of Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\n\nA competitive edge for Tesla is its ability to attract and retain high quality employees. During the past year, Tesla made substantial investments in its workforce, further strengthening its standing as one of the most desirable and innovative companies to work for. As of December 31, 2023, our employee headcount worldwide was 140,473.\n\n\nWe have created an environment that fosters growth opportunities, and as of this report, nearly two-thirds (65%) of our managers were promoted from an internal, non-manager position, and 43% of our management employees have been with Tesla for more than five years. Tesla's growth of 35% over the past two years has offered internal career development to our employees as well as the ability to make a meaningful contribution to a sustainable future.\n\n\nWe are able to retain our employees, in part, not only because employees can enjoy ownership in Tesla through stock (of which 89% have been given the opportunity to), but because we also provide them with excellent health benefits such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off and zero-premium medical plan options that are made available on the first day of employment.\n\n\nWe recognize the positive impact that leaders can have on their teams and offer fundamental skills training and continuous development to all leaders through various programs globally.\n\n\nWe don't stop there. Tesla has several other programs strategically designed to increase paths for greater career opportunity such as:\n\n\n\u2022Technician Trainee (Service)\u2013The Tesla Technician Trainee Program provides on-the-job automotive maintenance training at Tesla, resulting in an industry certification. Targeted at individuals with limited experience, whether in industry or vocational schools, the program prepares trainees for employment as technicians. In 2023, we hired over 1,900 Technician Trainees across the U.S., Germany and China.\n\n\n\u2022START (Manufacturing and Service)\u2013 Tesla START is an intensive training program that complements the Technician Trainee program and equips individuals with the skills needed for a successful technician role at Tesla. We have partnered with colleges and technical academies to launch Tesla START in the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany. In 2023, we hired over 350 trainees for manufacturing and service roles through this program, providing an opportunity to transition into full-time employment.\n\n\n\u2022Internships\u2013 Annually, Tesla hires over 6,000 university and college students from around the world. We recruit from diverse student organizations and campuses, seeking top talent passionate about our mission. Our interns engage in meaningful work from day one, and we often offer them full-time positions post-internship.\n\n\n\u2022Military Fellowship and Transition Programs \u2013The Military Fellowship and Transition Programs are designed to offer exiting military service members in the U.S. and Europe with career guidance on transitioning into the civil workforce. We partner with the career transition services of European Defence Ministries across five countries, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hire our Heroes. These programs aim to convert high-performing individuals to full-time roles and create a veteran talent pipeline.\n\n\n\u2022Apprenticeships\u2013 Tesla Apprenticeships are offered globally, providing academic and on-the-job training to prepare specialists in skilled trades. Apprentices will complete between one to four years of on-the-job training. Apprentice programs have seen skilled trade hires across the U.S., Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and Germany.\n\n\n\u2022Manufacturing Development Program\u2013\u202fTesla's manufacturing pathway program is designed to provide graduating high school seniors with the financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 373 graduates through this program in 2023, and our goal in 2024 is grow this program to over 600 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory New York.\n\n\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022Engineering Development Program\u2013\u202fLaunched in January 2024, this program targets recent college and university graduates for specialized engineering fields. In collaboration with Austin Community College, the program educates early-career engineers in controls engineering, enhancing their knowledge of high-demand technologies for U.S. manufacturing.\n\n\nWe will continue to expand the opportunities for our employees to add skills and develop professionally with a new Employee Educational Assistance Program launching in the U.S. in the spring of 2024 to help employees pursue select certificates or degrees. With virtual, self-paced education options available, employees can pursue a new path or expand their knowledge while continuing to grow their career.\n\n\nAt Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. We remain unwavering in our demand that our factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote fairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status.\n\n\nAnti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees and reoccurring for leaders. In addition, we run various leadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders' skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to appropriately respond to and address employee concerns.\n\n\nEmployees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety concerns and can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting concerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their Human Resource Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls. Responding to questions timely is key so Human Resource Partners for each functional area are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in driving culture and engagement alongside business leaders.\n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. Our website is located atwww.tesla.com, and our reports, amendments thereto, proxy statements and other information are also made available, free of charge, on our investor relations website atir.tesla.comas soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the SEC. The information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\n\n\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\n\n\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.\n\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\n\n\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\n\n\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\n\n\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.\n\n\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers' homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.\n\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.\n\n\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are\n\n\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.\n\n\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers' demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\n\n\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\n\n\n\u2022perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n\n\n\u2022perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\n\n\n\u2022competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n\n\n\u2022volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\n\n\n\u2022government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\n\n\n\u2022concerns about our future viability.\n\n\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain government and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater benefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\n\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\n\n\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\n\n\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD Capability features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products' capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.\n\n\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\n\n\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA's Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell's release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\n\n\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\n\n\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla's products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\n\n\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs.\n\n\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\n\n\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles' residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\n\n\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nSimilarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.\n\n\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York.\n\n\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the \"SUNY Foundation\"). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2023, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a \"program payment\" of $41million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\n\n\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\n\n\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.\n\n\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of X Corp., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\n\n\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\n\n\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\n\n\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\n\n\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers' systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers' systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers' security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\n\n\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\n\n\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\n\n\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products' systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\n\n\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\n\n\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\n\n\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies' operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\"), and they may do so in the future. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla's treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\n\n\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\n\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\n\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers' warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\n\n\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management's best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\n\n\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\n\n\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\n\n\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\n\n\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\n\n\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\n\n\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11,Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\n\n\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\n\n\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\n\n\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.\n\n\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party's intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company's ESG practices may result in additional costs or risks.\n\n\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.\n\n\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.\n\n\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or other events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\n\n\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products.\n\n\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.\n\n\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\n\n\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\n\n\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products.\n\n\nAs we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have\n\n\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nincreased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China.\n\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\n\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection\n\n\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nauthority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers' personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle. A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\n\n\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15,Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\n\n\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\n\n\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\n\n\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\n\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $299.29 per share and a low of $152.37 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\n\n\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\n\n\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\n\n\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\n\n\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\n\n\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt.\n\n\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.None.\n\n\n28Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2023, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading \"Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences\" included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\n\n\n29\n\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including security, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.We are headquartered in Austin, Texas. Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia utilized for manufacturing and assembly, warehousing, engineering, retail and service locations, Supercharger sites and administrative and sales offices. Our facilities are used to support both of our reporting segments, and are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business. We generally lease such facilities with the primary exception of some manufacturing facilities.

For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2022-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 31, 2023.\n\n\nOverview and 2023 Highlights\n\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.\n\n\nIn 2023, we produced 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\n\n\nIn 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and 223 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems.\n\n\nIn 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\n\n\nIn 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the prior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue to focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.\n\n\nWe ended 2023 with $29.09 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $6.91 billion from the end of 2022. Our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 and 2022 were $13.26 billion and $14.72 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.47 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $8.90 billion in 2023, compared to $7.16 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $1.74 billion. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.\n\n\n33\n\n\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\n\n\nAutomotive\u2014Production\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\n\nProduction Location\n\n\nVehicle Model(s)\n\n\nProduction Status\n\n\nFremont Factory\n\n\nModel S / Model X\n\n\nActive\n\n\nModel 3 / Model Y\n\n\nActive\n\n\nGigafactory Shanghai\n\n\nModel 3 / Model Y\n\n\nActive\n\n\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\n\n\nModel Y\n\n\nActive\n\n\nGigafactory Texas\n\n\nModel Y\n\n\nActive\n\n\nCybertruck\n\n\nActive\n\n\nGigafactory Nevada\n\n\nTesla Semi\n\n\nPilot production\n\n\nVarious\n\n\nNext Generation Platform\n\n\nIn development\n\n\nTBD\n\n\nTesla Roadster\n\n\nIn development\n\n\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and next generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our next generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\n\n\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\n\nAutomotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\n\n\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles' affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles' performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features and delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\n\n\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers' liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth.\n\n\n34\n\n\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\"NACS\") and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be between $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\n\n\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\n\n\n35\n\n\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nAutomotive Sales\n\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606,Revenue from Contracts with Customers(\"ASC 606\"), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\n\nInventory Valuation\n\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n\n36\n\n\nWarranties\n\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the \"ESPP\") to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n\n\n37\n\n\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\nAutomotive sales\n\n\n$\n\n\n78,509\n\n\n$\n\n\n67,210\n\n\n$\n\n\n44,125\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,299\n\n\n17\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n23,085\n\n\n52\n\n\n%\n\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits\n\n\n1,790\n\n\n1,776\n\n\n1,465\n\n\n14\n\n\n1\n\n\n%\n\n\n311\n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\nAutomotive leasing\n\n\n2,120\n\n\n2,476\n\n\n1,642\n\n\n(356)\n\n\n(14)\n\n\n%\n\n\n834\n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal automotive revenues\n\n\n82,419\n\n\n71,462\n\n\n47,232\n\n\n10,957\n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n24,230\n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n8,319\n\n\n6,091\n\n\n3,802\n\n\n2,228\n\n\n37\n\n\n%\n\n\n2,289\n\n\n60\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue\n\n\n90,738\n\n\n77,553\n\n\n51,034\n\n\n13,185\n\n\n17\n\n\n%\n\n\n26,519\n\n\n52\n\n\n%\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue\n\n\n6,035\n\n\n3,909\n\n\n2,789\n\n\n2,126\n\n\n54\n\n\n%\n\n\n1,120\n\n\n40\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n96,773\n\n\n$\n\n\n81,462\n\n\n$\n\n\n53,823\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,311\n\n\n19\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n27,639\n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\n\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck vehicles, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\n\n\n2023 compared to 2022\n\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $11.30 billion, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of 473,382 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries from production ramping of Model Y globally. The increase was partially offset by a lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year, sales mix, and a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.\n\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue increased $14 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\n38\n\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue decreased $356 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year, partially offset by an increase from our growing direct operating lease portfolio.\n\n\nServices and other revenue increased $2.23 billion, or 37%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume, body shop and part sales revenue, non-warranty maintenance services revenue, paid Supercharging revenue and insurance services revenue, all of which are primarily attributable to our growing fleet. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of used vehicles.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, financing of solar energy generation products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\n\n2023 compared to 2022\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue increased $2.13 billion, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack.\n\n\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\nCost of revenues\n\n\nAutomotive sales\n\n\n$\n\n\n65,121\n\n\n$\n\n\n49,599\n\n\n$\n\n\n32,415\n\n\n$\n\n\n15,522\n\n\n31\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n17,184\n\n\n53\n\n\n%\n\n\nAutomotive leasing\n\n\n1,268\n\n\n1,509\n\n\n978\n\n\n(241)\n\n\n(16)\n\n\n%\n\n\n531\n\n\n54\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal automotive cost of revenues\n\n\n66,389\n\n\n51,108\n\n\n33,393\n\n\n15,281\n\n\n30\n\n\n%\n\n\n17,715\n\n\n53\n\n\n%\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n7,830\n\n\n5,880\n\n\n3,906\n\n\n1,950\n\n\n33\n\n\n%\n\n\n1,974\n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues\n\n\n74,219\n\n\n56,988\n\n\n37,299\n\n\n17,231\n\n\n30\n\n\n%\n\n\n19,689\n\n\n53\n\n\n%\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage segment\n\n\n4,894\n\n\n3,621\n\n\n2,918\n\n\n1,273\n\n\n35\n\n\n%\n\n\n703\n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal cost of revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n79,113\n\n\n$\n\n\n60,609\n\n\n$\n\n\n40,217\n\n\n$\n\n\n18,504\n\n\n31\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,392\n\n\n51\n\n\n%\n\n\nGross profit total automotive\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,030\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,354\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,839\n\n\nGross margin total automotive\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n28.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n29.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nGross profit total automotive & services and other segment\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,519\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,565\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,735\n\n\nGross margin total automotive & services and other segment\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n26.9\n\n\n%\n\n\nGross profit energy generation and storage segment\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,141\n\n\n$\n\n\n288\n\n\n$\n\n\n(129)\n\n\nGross margin energy generation and storage segment\n\n\n18.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n(4.6)\n\n\n%\n\n\nTotal gross profit\n\n\n$\n\n\n17,660\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,853\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,606\n\n\nTotal gross margin\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n25.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n25.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n39\n\n\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\n\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned.\n\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for retail merchandise.\n\n\n2023 compared to 2022\n\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue increased $15.52 billion, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Cost of automotive sales revenue increased in line with the change in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily due to sales mix, lower inbound freight, a decrease in material costs and lower manufacturing costs from better fixed cost absorption. Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods and by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\n\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year.\n\n\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.95 billion, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was generally in line with the changes in services and other revenue as discussed above.\n\n\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 28.5% to 19.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our average combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.\n\n\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.5% to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n\n2023 compared to 2022\n\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.27 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, in line with the increase in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by an improvement in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack as well as IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\n\n\n40\n\n\nGross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 7.4% to 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by an improvement in our Megapack gross margin from lower average cost per MWh and a higher proportion of Megapack, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment as compared to the prior year periods. Additionally, there was a margin benefit from IRA manufacturing credits earned.\n\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n\n\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n%\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,969\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,075\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,593\n\n\n$\n\n\n894\n\n\n29\n\n\n%\n\n\n$\n\n\n482\n\n\n19\n\n\n%\n\n\nAs a percentage of revenues\n\n\n4\n\n\n%\n\n\n4\n\n\n%\n\n\n5\n\n\n%\n\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense.\n\n\nR&D expenses increased $894 million, or 29%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. Approximately $5.93 billion of the total valuation allowance release was related to deferred tax assets to be realized in the future years and the remainder benefited us during the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\n\n\nOur (benefit from) provision for income taxes changed by $6.13 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets.\n\n\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 8% to a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance regarding our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets.\n\n\nSee Note 14,Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\n\n\n42\n\n\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2023, as well as in the long-term.\n\n\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n\n\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\n\n\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook\u2014Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be between $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15,Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.98 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments was $5.96 billion, of which $1.31 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11,Debt, and Note 12,Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\n\n\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $16.40 billion and $12.70 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.43 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.03 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of December 31, 2023. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11,Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.\n\n\n43\n\n\nSummary of Cash Flows\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,256\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,724\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,497\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n(15,584)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(11,973)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(7,868)\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,589\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,527)\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,203)\n\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.47 billion to $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 from $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $2.93 billion, partially offset by favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.46 billion.\n\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\n\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $8.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly for global factory expansion and machinery and equipment as we expand our product roadmap. We also purchased $6.62 billion and $5.81 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, proceeds from sales of digital assets was $936 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\n\nNet cash from financing activities changed by $6.12 billion to $2.59 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 from $3.53 billion net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to a $3.93 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $2.01 billion decrease in repayments of debt. See Note 11,Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nSee Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n44Foreign Currency Risk\n\n\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\n\n\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\n\n\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023 and $473 million at December 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\n\n\n45Index to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\nPage\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(PCAOB ID:238)\n\n\n47\n\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n\n49\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n\n50\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n\n\n51\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Equity\n\n\n52\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n\n53\n\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n54\n\n\n46\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo theBoard of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc.\n\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n\nChanges in Accounting Principles\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021.\n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\n47\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\n\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $5,152 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company provides a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management's best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management's significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one of the following: (i) testing management's process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management's estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management's process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management's significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\n\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n\nSan Jose,

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810,Consolidation(\"ASC 810\"), we consolidate any variable interest entity (\"VIE\") of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\n\nUse of Estimates\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n\nReclassifications\n\n\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\n\n\n54\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nRevenue by source\n\n\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nAutomotive sales\n\n\n$\n\n\n78,509\n\n\n$\n\n\n67,210\n\n\n$\n\n\n44,125\n\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits\n\n\n1,790\n\n\n1,776\n\n\n1,465\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales\n\n\n5,515\n\n\n3,376\n\n\n2,279\n\n\nServices and other\n\n\n8,319\n\n\n6,091\n\n\n3,802\n\n\nTotal revenues from sales and services\n\n\n94,133\n\n\n78,453\n\n\n51,671\n\n\nAutomotive leasing\n\n\n2,120\n\n\n2,476\n\n\n1,642\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\n\n\n520\n\n\n533\n\n\n510\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n96,773\n\n\n$\n\n\n81,462\n\n\n$\n\n\n53,823\n\n\nAutomotive Segment\n\n\nAutomotive Sales\n\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n\n55\n\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle's contract residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460,Guaranteesand record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was immaterial as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nDeferred revenue\u2014 beginning of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,913\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,382\n\n\nAdditions\n\n\n1,201\n\n\n1,178\n\n\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\n\n\n17\n\n\n(67)\n\n\nRevenue recognized\n\n\n(595)\n\n\n(580)\n\n\nDeferred revenue\u2014 end of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,536\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,913\n\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $469million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $472million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $926million of revenue in the next12months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\n\n\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242million and $128million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $1.04billion and $665million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\n\n\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\n\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\n\n\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\n\n\n56\n\n\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\n\n\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\n\n\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to48months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues toautomotive leasing revenueon a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86billion, $1.75billion and $1.25billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458million and $407million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\n\n\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842,Leases(\"ASC 842\"), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to72months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215million, $683million and $369million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $164million, $427million and $234million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\n\n\nServices and Other Revenue\n\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\n\n\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n\n57\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\n\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\n\n\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\n\n\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\n\n\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\n\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.60billion and $863million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571million and $171million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05billion in the next12months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\n\n\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $31million and $24million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $578million and $387million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\n\n\n58\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\n\n\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840,Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $181million and $191million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.\n\n\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\n\n\nCost of Revenues\n\n\nAutomotive Segment\n\n\nAutomotive Sales\n\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned.\n\n\nAutomotive Leasing\n\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n\nServices and Other\n\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for retail merchandise.\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\n\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n\n59\n\n\nResearch and Development Costs\n\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nComprehensive Income\n\n\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generallyfour yearsfor stock options and RSUs andsix monthsfor the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\n\n60\n\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\n\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties' interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there have been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached.\n\n\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\n\n\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.\n\n\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11,Debt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\n\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,997\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,556\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,519\n\n\nLess: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(27)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock\n\n\n14,999\n\n\n12,583\n\n\n5,524\n\n\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(9)\n\n\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock\n\n\n$\n\n\n14,999\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,584\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,533\n\n\n61\n\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic\n\n\n3,174\n\n\n3,130\n\n\n2,959\n\n\nAdd:\n\n\nStock-based awards\n\n\n298\n\n\n310\n\n\n292\n\n\nConvertible senior notes\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n29\n\n\nWarrants\n\n\n11\n\n\n32\n\n\n106\n\n\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted\n\n\n3,485\n\n\n3,475\n\n\n3,386\n\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nStock-based awards\n\n\n12\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\n\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805,Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. government securities, money market funds and commercial paper.\n\n\nRestricted Cash\n\n\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\n\n\n62\n\n\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nDecember 31,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDecember 31,2021\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,398\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,253\n\n\n$\n\n\n17,576\n\n\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n\n543\n\n\n294\n\n\n345\n\n\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets\n\n\n248\n\n\n377\n\n\n223\n\n\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows\n\n\n$\n\n\n17,189\n\n\n$\n\n\n16,924\n\n\n$\n\n\n18,144\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\nInvestments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, includingU.S. government securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, time deposits, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders' equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nThe cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n\n\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\n\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207million and $753million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\nFinancing Receivables\n\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\n\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\n\n63\n\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define \"past due\" as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.\n\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a30-yearloan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $266million and $280million, respectively, of which $5million and $7million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for expected credit losses was $36million and $37million, respectively.\n\n\nConcentration of Risk\n\n\nCredit Risk\n\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n\nSupply Risk\n\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\nInventory Valuation\n\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n\nOperating Lease Vehicles\n\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period.The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.36billion and $6.08billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.38billion and $1.04billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\n64\n\n\nDigital Assets, Net\n\n\nWe currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350,Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.\n\n\nWe determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820,Fair Value Measurement(\"ASC 820\"), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the prices determined.\n\n\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\n\n\nSee Note 3,Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\n\n\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\n\n\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n\n\nSolar energy systems in service\n\n\n30to35years\n\n\nInitial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs\n\n\nLease term (up to25years)\n\n\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\n\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n\n\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\n\n\n3to15years\n\n\nTooling\n\n\n4to7years\n\n\nBuilding and building improvements\n\n\n15to30years\n\n\nComputer equipment and software\n\n\n3to10years\n\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\n\n\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\n\n\n65\n\n\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\n\n\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\n\n\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\n\n\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range fromseventothirty years.\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit's fair value.For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we didnot recognize any impairment of goodwill.\n\n\nCapitalization of Software Costs\n\n\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life ofthreetofive years.\n\n\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\n\n\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\n\n\nForeign Currency\n\n\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\n\n\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $122million, loss of $89million and gain of $97million, respectively.\n\n\n66\n\n\nWarranties\n\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between10to25years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nAccrued warranty\u2014beginning of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,505\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,101\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,468\n\n\nWarranty costs incurred\n\n\n(1,225)\n\n\n(803)\n\n\n(525)\n\n\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact\n\n\n539\n\n\n522\n\n\n102\n\n\nProvision for warranty\n\n\n2,333\n\n\n1,685\n\n\n1,056\n\n\nAccrued warranty\u2014end of period\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,152\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,505\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,101\n\n\nCustomer Deposits\n\n\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer's purchase balance.\n\n\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\n\n\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.\n\n\nThe IRA Incentives\n\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our material costs in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n67\n\n\nGigafactory New York\u2014New York State Investment and Lease\n\n\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15,Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nGigafactory Shanghai\u2014Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\n\n\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15,Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $76million. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related equipment.\n\n\nNevada Tax Incentives\n\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\n\n\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\n\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a20-yearagreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate10-yearagreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations.As of December 31, 2023, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.\n\n\nDefined Contribution Plan\n\n\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match50% of each employee's contributions up to a maximum of6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee's eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service.During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $99million and $91million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\n\n\n68\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted.We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the consolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted.We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will affect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once adopted.\n\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\n\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n69\n\n\nASU 2020-06\n\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211million cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474million and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance by $269million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45million related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n\n\nNote 3 \u2013Digital Assets, Net\n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded animmaterialamount of impairment losses on digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204million of impairment losses on digital assets and realized gains of $64million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n70\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nFair Value\n\n\nLevel I\n\n\nLevel II\n\n\nLevel III\n\n\nFair Value\n\n\nLevel I\n\n\nLevel II\n\n\nLevel III\n\n\nMoney market funds\n\n\n$\n\n\n109\n\n\n$\n\n\n109\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,188\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,188\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nU.S. government securities\n\n\n5,136\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n5,136\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n894\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n894\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nCorporate debt securities\n\n\n480\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n480\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n885\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n885\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n\n\n6,996\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n6,996\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,253\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n4,253\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nCommercial paper\n\n\n470\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n470\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,191\n\n\n$\n\n\n109\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,082\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,220\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,188\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,032\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nAll of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets.

Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $2.02billion and $2.01billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.\n\n\n73\n\n\nNote 9 \u2013Accrued Liabilities and Other\n\n\nOur accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\nDecember 31,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nAccrued purchases (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,721\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,747\n\n\nAccrued warranty reserve, current portion\n\n\n1,546\n\n\n1,025\n\n\nPayroll and related costs\n\n\n1,325\n\n\n1,026\n\n\nTaxes payable (2)\n\n\n1,204\n\n\n1,235\n\n\nCustomer deposits\n\n\n876\n\n\n1,063\n\n\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\n\n\n672\n\n\n485\n\n\nSales return reserve, current portion\n\n\n219\n\n\n270\n\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n\n517\n\n\n354\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,080\n\n\n$\n\n\n8,205\n\n\n(1)Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we had not yet been invoiced.

As of December 31, 2023, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $406million. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.\n\n\nCredit Agreement\n\n\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a)1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus0.50%, (ii) the lenders' \"prime rate\" or (iii)1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.\n\n\nIn January 2023, we entered into a5-yearsenior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"RCF Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement containstwooptionalone-yearextensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00billion, which could be increased up to $7.00billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the \"Credit Rating\") from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently0.125% per annum.\n\n\n75\n\n\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\n\n\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose entities (\"SPEs\") and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs' expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs' assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\n\n\nIn 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and financing receivables into SPEs and issued $3.93billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $3.92billion.\n\n\nCash Equity Debt\n\n\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\n\n\nAutomotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer available for future borrowings.\n\n\nPledged Assets\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged or restricted $4.64billion and $2.02billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.\n\n\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\n\n\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\nRecourse debt\n\n\nNon-recourse debt\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n37\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,941\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,978\n\n\n2025\n\n\n4\n\n\n1,663\n\n\n1,667\n\n\n2026\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n494\n\n\n494\n\n\n2027\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n276\n\n\n276\n\n\n2028\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n44\n\n\n44\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n3\n\n\n221\n\n\n224\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n44\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,639\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,683\n\n\nNote 12 \u2013Leases\n\n\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\n\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\n\n\n76\n\n\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\n\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to10years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\n\n\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nOperating leases:\n\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,180\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,563\n\n\nAccrued liabilities and other\n\n\n$\n\n\n672\n\n\n$\n\n\n485\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n3,671\n\n\n2,164\n\n\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,343\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,649\n\n\nFinance leases:\n\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n\n$\n\n\n23\n\n\n$\n\n\n25\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n\n601\n\n\n1,094\n\n\nTotal finance lease assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n624\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,119\n\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases\n\n\n$\n\n\n398\n\n\n$\n\n\n486\n\n\nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion\n\n\n175\n\n\n568\n\n\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n573\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,054\n\n\n77\n\n\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations:\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nOperating lease expense:\n\n\nOperating lease expense (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,153\n\n\n$\n\n\n798\n\n\n$\n\n\n627\n\n\nFinance lease expense:\n\n\nAmortization of leased assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n506\n\n\n$\n\n\n493\n\n\n$\n\n\n415\n\n\nInterest on lease liabilities\n\n\n45\n\n\n72\n\n\n89\n\n\nTotal finance lease expense\n\n\n$\n\n\n551\n\n\n$\n\n\n565\n\n\n$\n\n\n504\n\n\nTotal lease expense\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,704\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,363\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,131\n\n\n(1)Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\n\n\nOther information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\n7.4years\n\n\n6.4years\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\n2.3years\n\n\n3.1years\n\n\nWeighted-average discount rate:\n\n\nOperating leases\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n%\n\n\nFinance leases\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n%\n\n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\n\n\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,084\n\n\n$\n\n\n754\n\n\n$\n\n\n616\n\n\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments)\n\n\n$\n\n\n47\n\n\n$\n\n\n75\n\n\n$\n\n\n89\n\n\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n$\n\n\n58\n\n\n$\n\n\n486\n\n\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,170\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,059\n\n\n$\n\n\n818\n\n\n78\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions):\n\n\nOperatingLeases\n\n\nFinanceLeases\n\n\n2024\n\n\n$\n\n\n892\n\n\n$\n\n\n418\n\n\n2025\n\n\n831\n\n\n81\n\n\n2026\n\n\n706\n\n\n57\n\n\n2027\n\n\n603\n\n\n38\n\n\n2028\n\n\n508\n\n\n2\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n1,820\n\n\n4\n\n\nTotal minimum lease payments\n\n\n5,360\n\n\n600\n\n\nLess: Interest\n\n\n1,017\n\n\n27\n\n\nPresent value of lease obligations\n\n\n4,343\n\n\n573\n\n\nLess: Current portion\n\n\n672\n\n\n398\n\n\nLong-term portion of lease obligations\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,671\n\n\n$\n\n\n175\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent payments of $1.53billion.

The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest overfour yearsand our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of10years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023,131.1million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.\n\n\n80\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n\nStock Options\n\n\nRSUs\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\nOptions\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\nWeighted-AverageExercisePrice\n\n\nWeighted-AverageRemainingContractualLife (years)\n\n\nAggregate\n\n\nIntrinsic\n\n\nValue\n\n\n(in billions)\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nof RSUs\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\nWeighted-AverageGrantDate FairValue\n\n\nBeginning of period\n\n\n343,564\n\n\n$\n\n\n30.65\n\n\n21,333\n\n\n$\n\n\n162.32\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n9,521\n\n\n$\n\n\n226.50\n\n\n11,743\n\n\n$\n\n\n228.33\n\n\nExercised or released\n\n\n(7,626)\n\n\n$\n\n\n43.07\n\n\n(11,085)\n\n\n$\n\n\n116.47\n\n\nCancelled\n\n\n(1,438)\n\n\n$\n\n\n194.23\n\n\n(2,903)\n\n\n$\n\n\n192.22\n\n\nEnd of period\n\n\n344,021\n\n\n$\n\n\n35.11\n\n\n4.31\n\n\n$\n\n\n73.57\n\n\n19,088\n\n\n$\n\n\n225.01\n\n\nVested and expected to vest, December 31, 2023\n\n\n340,884\n\n\n$\n\n\n33.38\n\n\n4.27\n\n\n$\n\n\n73.45\n\n\n18,446\n\n\n$\n\n\n225.76\n\n\nExercisable and vested, December 31, 2023\n\n\n329,124\n\n\n$\n\n\n27.07\n\n\n4.11\n\n\n$\n\n\n72.90\n\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $228.33, $239.85and $261.33, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted to an intrinsic value of $23.45billion.\n\n\nESPP\n\n\nOur employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of eachsix-monthoffering period. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the ESPP we issued2.1million,1.4million and1.5million shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there were97.8million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\n\n\nFair Value Assumptions\n\n\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n\n3.90\n\n\n%\n\n\n3.11\n\n\n%\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n%\n\n\nExpected term (in years)\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n4.3\n\n\nExpected volatility\n\n\n63\n\n\n%\n\n\n63\n\n\n%\n\n\n59\n\n\n%\n\n\nDividend yield\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\nGrant date fair value per share\n\n\n$\n\n\n121.62\n\n\n$\n\n\n114.51\n\n\n$\n\n\n128.02\n\n\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant's expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n\n\n81\n\n\n2018 CEO Performance Award\n\n\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors' grant of304.0million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the \"2018 CEO Performance Award\"). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of12vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the12vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100.0billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), had been achieved, and (ii) any one of the followingeightoperational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of theeightoperational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA had been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA was defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $23.34per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires forfive yearspost-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2023 is provided below.\n\n\nTotal Annualized Revenue\n\n\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\nMilestone\n\n\n(in billions)\n\n\nAchievement Status\n\n\nMilestone\n\n\n(in billions)\n\n\nAchievement Status\n\n\n$\n\n\n20.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n1.5\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n35.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n3.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n55.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n75.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n6.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n-\n\n\n$\n\n\n8.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n125.0\n\n\n-\n\n\n$\n\n\n10.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n150.0\n\n\n-\n\n\n$\n\n\n12.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\n$\n\n\n175.0\n\n\n-\n\n\n$\n\n\n14.0\n\n\nAchieved\n\n\nStock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represented a non-cash expense and was recorded as a Selling, general, and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we had recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of12tranches) that corresponded to the number of operational milestones that had been achieved or had been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles.\n\n\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its \"expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.\" Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter, we determined whether it was probable that we would achieve each operational milestone that had not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expected to achieve that operational milestone, or its \"expected operational milestone achievement time.\"\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $66million and $910million, respectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\n\n\n82\n\n\nOther Performance-Based Grants\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $655million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate5.3million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $110million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of4.0years.\n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $57million and $159million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures.\n\n\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCost of revenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n741\n\n\n$\n\n\n594\n\n\n$\n\n\n421\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n689\n\n\n536\n\n\n448\n\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n382\n\n\n430\n\n\n1,252\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,812\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,560\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,121\n\n\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements wereimmaterialwhile we were under full valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our federal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense were $326million during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets was $199million, $245million and $182million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $4.82billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of2.8years.\n\n\nNote 14 \u2013Income Taxes\n\n\nOur income before (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nDomestic\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,196\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,524\n\n\n$\n\n\n(130)\n\n\nNoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest\n\n\n(23)\n\n\n31\n\n\n125\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n6,800\n\n\n8,164\n\n\n6,348\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,973\n\n\n$\n\n\n13,719\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,343\n\n\n83\n\n\nA (benefit from) provision for income taxes of $(5.00) billion, $1.13billion and $699million has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The components of the (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCurrent:\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nState\n\n\n57\n\n\n62\n\n\n9\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n1,243\n\n\n1,266\n\n\n839\n\n\nTotal current\n\n\n1,348\n\n\n1,328\n\n\n848\n\n\nDeferred:\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n(5,246)\n\n\n26\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nState\n\n\n(653)\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nForeign\n\n\n(450)\n\n\n(223)\n\n\n(149)\n\n\nTotal deferred\n\n\n(6,349)\n\n\n(196)\n\n\n(149)\n\n\nTotal (Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,001)\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,132\n\n\n$\n\n\n699\n\n\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\nTax at statutory federal rate\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,094\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,881\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,332\n\n\nState tax, net of federal benefit\n\n\n(372)\n\n\n51\n\n\n6\n\n\nNondeductible executive compensation\n\n\n23\n\n\n14\n\n\n201\n\n\nExcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation\n\n\n(288)\n\n\n(745)\n\n\n(7,123)\n\n\nNontaxable manufacturing credit\n\n\n(101)\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nForeign income rate differential\n\n\n(816)\n\n\n(923)\n\n\n(668)\n\n\nU.S. tax credits\n\n\n(593)\n\n\n(276)\n\n\n(328)\n\n\nGILTI inclusion\n\n\n670\n\n\n1,279\n\n\n1,008\n\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n\n\n183\n\n\n252\n\n\n28\n\n\nChange in valuation allowance\n\n\n(5,962)\n\n\n(1,532)\n\n\n6,165\n\n\nOther\n\n\n161\n\n\n131\n\n\n78\n\n\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n\n\n$\n\n\n(5,001)\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,132\n\n\n$\n\n\n699\n\n\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\n\n\n84\n\n\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n\nDecember 31,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nDeferred tax assets:\n\n\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,826\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,486\n\n\nResearch and development credits\n\n\n1,358\n\n\n1,184\n\n\nOther tax credits and attributes\n\n\n827\n\n\n217\n\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n\n1,035\n\n\n751\n\n\nInventory and warranty reserves\n\n\n1,258\n\n\n819\n\n\nStock-based compensation\n\n\n230\n\n\n185\n\n\nOperating lease right-of-use liabilities\n\n\n930\n\n\n554\n\n\nCapitalized research and development costs\n\n\n1,344\n\n\n693\n\n\nDeferred GILTI tax assets\n\n\n760\n\n\n466\n\n\nAccruals and others\n\n\n206\n\n\n178\n\n\nTotal deferred tax assets\n\n\n10,774\n\n\n9,533\n\n\nValuation allowance\n\n\n(892)\n\n\n(7,349)\n\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n\n9,882\n\n\n2,184\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n(2,122)\n\n\n(1,178)\n\n\nInvestment in certain financing funds\n\n\n(133)\n\n\n(238)\n\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n\n(859)\n\n\n(506)\n\n\nOther\n\n\n(116)\n\n\n(15)\n\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n\n\n(3,230)\n\n\n(1,937)\n\n\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,652\n\n\n$\n\n\n247\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained valuation allowances of $892million for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized, which primarily included deferred tax assets in the state of California and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets decreased by $6.46billion and $1.73billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by $6.14billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowances during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective year. Among our deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses that are not more likely than not to be realized. The remainder of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.31billion of federal and $10.36billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.10billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $605million, and state research and development tax credits of $923million. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in2036. However, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n\n85\n\n\nThe local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of15% for 2019 through 2023. Starting in 2024, Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest,nodeferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $245million.\n\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\n\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n$\n\n\n380\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n\n117\n\n\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n\n(90)\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\n\n\n124\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n531\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n\n136\n\n\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n\n(12)\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\n\n\n222\n\n\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n\n870\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n\n59\n\n\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\n\n\n255\n\n\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,174\n\n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $17million, $27million and $4million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we have accrued $47million and $31million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $901million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\n\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\n\n\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\n\n\nNote 15 \u2013Commitments and Contingencies\n\n\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\n\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\n\n\n86\n\n\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the10-yearperiod beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41million \"program payment\" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\n\n\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2023, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement based on our current and anticipated level of operations. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.\n\n\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of50years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB14.08billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which has been achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB2.23billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we have met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.\n\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\n\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\n\n\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete.\n\n\nLitigation Related to Directors' Compensation\n\n\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla's current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla's directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\n\n\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels' fee request under advisement. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\n\n\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018,ninepurported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk's August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla's board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n87\n\n\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021,sevenderivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things.Fiveof those actions were consolidated, and allsevenactions have been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases,twoderivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company's 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company's corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys' fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 5, 2024.\n\n\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (\"JP Morgan\") filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk's August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan's adjustment as a violation of the parties' agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.\n\n\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla's Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was held starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $136.9million (October 4, 2021) down to $15million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175million (April 3, 2023). On November 2, 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on November 16, 2023, Tesla filed a notice of cross appeal.\n\n\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (\"CRD,\" formerly \"DFEH\") filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD's amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery.\n\n\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD's allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On December 18, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to stay the case. Separately, on December 26, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to dismiss the case.\n\n\nOn June 16, 2022,twoTesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla's current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys' fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated thetwocases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\n\n88\n\n\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\n\n\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company's driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \"Full Self-Driving Capability\" (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla's motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company's Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\n\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla's motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla's motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also appealed the court's arbitration order. Trial is currently set for July 7, 2025.\n\n\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\n\n\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\n\n\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla's business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\n\n89\n\n\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\n\nLetters of Credit\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $525million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\n\n\nNote 16 \u2013Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\n\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\n\n\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\n\n\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor's interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\n\n\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\n\n\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund's creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\n\n\n90\n\n\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs' assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\n\n\nDecember 31,2023\n\n\nDecember 31,2022\n\n\nAssets\n\n\nCurrent assets\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n66\n\n\n$\n\n\n68\n\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n\n13\n\n\n22\n\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n\n361\n\n\n274\n\n\nTotal current assets\n\n\n440\n\n\n364\n\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n\n3,278\n\n\n4,060\n\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n\n369\n\n\n404\n\n\nTotal assets\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,087\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,828\n\n\nLiabilities\n\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\n\nAccrued liabilities and other\n\n\n$\n\n\n67\n\n\n$\n\n\n69\n\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n\n6\n\n\n10\n\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\n\n\n1,564\n\n\n1,013\n\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n\n1,637\n\n\n1,092\n\n\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\n\n\n99\n\n\n149\n\n\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\n\n\n2,041\n\n\n971\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n3\n\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,777\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,215\n\n\nNote 17 \u2013Related Party Transactions\n\n\nIn relation to our CEO's exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed, if any.\n\n\nTesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and X Corp., in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n91\n\n\nNote 18 \u2013Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\n\n\nWe havetwooperating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.

We also recorded other expenses of $36million during the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, related to employee terminations.\n\n\n92None.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n\n\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\n\n\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n93None of the Company's directors or officersadopted, modified orterminateda Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:\n\n\nOnOctober 23, 2023,Robyn Denholm, one of ourdirectors,adopteda Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the potential sale of up to281,116shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions.
